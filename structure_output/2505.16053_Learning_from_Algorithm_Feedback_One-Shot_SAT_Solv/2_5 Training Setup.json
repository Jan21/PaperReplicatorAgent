        "The computational cost of these solver calls imposes a constraint: training must be performed on a distribution of SAT problems that can be solved very quickly (fractions of a second).",
        "The authors frame this as a small-scale demonstration using single CPU/GPU machines, with the potential to scale up by using distributed computing.",
        "A crucial result highlighted is that despite being trained on easy problems, the learned policies generalize effectively to significantly harder and larger problems."
