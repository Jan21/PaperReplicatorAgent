  "key_points": [
    "The algorithm takes a Boolean formula as input and recursively searches for a satisfying assignment.",
    "It first simplifies the formula using unit propagation and pure literal elimination.",
    "The core of the algorithm is a branching step where it picks a literal and explores both possible truth assignments.",
    "It returns SAT if the formula simplifies to empty (satisfied) and UNSAT if a contradiction (empty clause) is found."
