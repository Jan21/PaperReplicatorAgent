        "The experiments aim to answer whether RLAF-trained GNN policies can shorten solver runtimes and generalize to harder formulas, and how they compare to supervised learning approaches.",
        "Experiments use two distinct base SAT solvers: the CDCL solver Glucose (good on structured problems) and the DPLL solver March (good on random instances).",
        "Three SAT problem classes with different structures are used: Random 3SAT, Graph Coloring (3COL), and Cryptographic instances (CRYPTO), each with training and progressively harder test sets.",
        "Main results (shown in a table) demonstrate that RLAF guidance significantly reduces the number of decisions and runtime for both solvers across all datasets, especially on larger/harder instances.",
        "Hyperparameters include a 10-layer GNN with embedding dimension 256, trained for 2000 GRPO iterations with specific batch sizes, using substantial computational resources."
