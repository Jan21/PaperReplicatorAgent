        "The Boolean SAT problem involves finding a satisfying assignment for a Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) formula and is NP-complete.",
        "Modern SAT solvers are based on the DPLL algorithm, enhanced by techniques like CDCL, where the branching heuristic for selecting literals is critical to performance.",
        "Reinforcement Learning (RL) is formalized as an MDP with the goal of learning an optimal policy that maximizes expected cumulative discounted reward.",
        "Recent RL algorithms (e.g., PPO, GRPO) are noted for their use in fine-tuning LLMs via feedback methods (RLHF, RLVR), hinting at a parallel for algorithm feedback.",
        "The SAT problem's hardness and the heuristic-dependent performance of solvers motivate the need for learned, data-driven guidance policies."
