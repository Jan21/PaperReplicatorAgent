  "key_points": [
    "Solving SAT problems is crucial in domains like verification and planning, but classical algorithms rely on rigid, hand-crafted heuristics.",
    "Machine learning, particularly reinforcement learning (RL), offers a way to create adaptable, data-driven heuristics without expert supervision.",
    "The paper proposes a novel method to integrate variable-wise weights into SAT solver branching heuristics using GNNs in a one-shot forward pass.",
    "The task is framed as an RL problem called Reinforcement Learning from Algorithm Feedback (RLAF), where the reward is based on computational cost.",
    "Empirical results show that RL-trained policies reduce solver runtimes, generalize to harder problems, and outperform supervised baselines."
