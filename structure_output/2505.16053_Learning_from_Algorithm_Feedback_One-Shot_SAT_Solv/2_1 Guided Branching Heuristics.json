  "section_purpose": "This section describes how to modify existing SAT solvers to incorporate external variable weights and polarities into their branching heuristics, enabling guidance from learned parameters without replacing the original heuristic.",
  "key_points": [
    "SAT solvers are assumed to be DPLL-derived with a branching heuristic that selects variables by maximizing a scoring function (like VSIDS or look-ahead).",
    "Variable weights are introduced to scale the existing scores, allowing external modulation of the heuristic: \\(\\hat{x} = \\mathrm{argmax}_{x} w(x) \\cdot \\mathrm{Score}(x)\\).",
    "Polarity mappings specify the first assigned value (0 or 1) when a variable is chosen, which can significantly impact solver performance.",
    "The modified solver takes a CNF formula and a variable parameterization \\(\\mathcal{W} = (w, p)\\) as input, where \\(w(x)\\) is a weight and \\(p(x)\\) is a polarity for each variable.",
    "The goal is to learn effective weights and polarities from the input formula's structure using a deep neural network (GNN)."

  "reproducibility_notes": [
    "The modification requires the base solver to follow the assumed pattern: DPLL-derived, with a variable scoring function and a secondary sign heuristic.",
