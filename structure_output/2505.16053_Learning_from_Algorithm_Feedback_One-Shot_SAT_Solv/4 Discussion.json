    "key_points": [
        "The paper's key contributions include: (i) a generic mechanism for injecting variable weights into branching heuristics, (ii) formulating weight selection as a one-shot RL problem, (iii) using GNNs as trainable policies, and (iv) experimental evidence that GRPO reduces solver computational cost.",
        "Learned policies generalize to larger, harder instances and outperform supervised baselines. Policies trained with different solvers converge to similar structural signals, indicating RLAF captures inherent SAT instance structure.",
        "Current implementation is a small-scale prototype limited to simpler formulas due to computational constraints. Expanding with distributed computing and improving GNN scalability/expressivity are key future directions.",
        "The methodology is not limited to SAT solvers and could be applied to other domains like Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) and Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP), where heuristic selection follows a similar scoring pattern.",
        "GNN limitations include bounded expressive power (limited by color refinement) and scalability challenges with large industrial instances, highlighting the need for more compact, domain-specific encodings."
