  "section_purpose": "To analyze the weight distributions learned by RLAF, investigating the correlation between policies trained with different base solvers and whether they capture predefined variable properties like backbone and UNSAT core membership.",
  "key_points": [
    "Variable weights learned by policies trained with different base solvers (Glucose and March) are correlated (Pearson r between 0.73 and 0.85), indicating they capture inherent structural properties of variables.",
    "For 3COL and CRYPTO instances, variables with high weights are predominantly members of the UNSAT core, showing RLAF self-discovers weight policies correlating with handcrafted heuristics.",
    "For 3SAT instances, there is no clear correlation between learned weight policies and backbone membership, indicating the models learn effective functions that do not resemble this handcrafted heuristic.",
    "The analysis is performed by plotting expected variable weights for policies from two solvers and computing Pearson correlation, with visual indication of backbone/UNSAT core membership."
