        "The core objective is to learn policy parameters θ that minimize the expected number of decisions (solver cost) when solving SAT instances from a training distribution Ω.",
        "The optimization is framed as a single-step Markov Decision Process where the state is the input formula φ, the action is choosing variable weights 𝒲, and the reward is the negative solver cost.",
        "Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is used, which simplifies PPO by eliminating the need for a value network and uses group-relative advantage normalization.",
        "The advantage for each action is calculated relative to other actions sampled for the same problem instance, normalized by mean and standard deviation.",
        "The training objective combines a clipped policy update term with a KL divergence penalty for stability."
