  "key_points": [
    "RLAF-guided training consistently accelerates base solvers (Glucose and March), though improvement margin varies by solver and problem class.",
    "For 3SAT(400) problems, RLAF reduces mean runtime of Glucose by 69% (satisfiable) and 41% (unsatisfiable). Substantial improvements also seen for satisfiable 3-coloring and cryptographic instances.",
    "The smallest improvement (or negative impact) is observed for March on unsatisfiable 3SAT instances, where GNN overhead outweighs decision reduction benefit.",
    "The GNN forward pass runtime (~0.1s) is included in measurements and is negligible compared to solver runtimes on harder problems.",
    "Results demonstrate that training on easier problems generalizes to more complex problems at test time."
