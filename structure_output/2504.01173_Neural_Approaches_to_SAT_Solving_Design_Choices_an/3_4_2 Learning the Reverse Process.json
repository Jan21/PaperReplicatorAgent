        "The fundamental goal is to learn the reverse process of a diffusion model, enabling the denoising of a corrupted sample back to the original data distribution.",
        "In the context of SAT solving, a GNN is trained to progressively recover a satisfiable assignment (x0) starting from a random initial state.",
        "The trained model defines a distribution p(x_{t-1}|x_t), used to sample an assignment x0 from a random assignment x_T.",
        "The specific training method adopted is from Austin et al. (2021), where the network predicts the original uncorrupted input x0 directly.",
        "This direct prediction approach provides stronger learning signals because the target x0 is fixed across all diffusion timesteps."
