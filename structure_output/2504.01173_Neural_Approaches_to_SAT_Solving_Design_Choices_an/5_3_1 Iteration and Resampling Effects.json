        "Increasing message-passing iterations from 25 to 125 consistently improves all performance metrics across benchmarks (SAT accuracy, decision accuracy, average gap).",
        "Multiple inference attempts with different random initializations (resampling) further enhances performance, e.g., for SR40, decision accuracy improves from 84% with one sample to 93% with five samples at 125 iterations.",
        "The novel 'Closest' supervision method (dynamically selecting assignments closest to current model predictions) consistently outperforms training with precalculated assignments across all datasets.",
        "For SR40, SAT-only training with closest assignment supervision achieves the highest SAT accuracy (76%), while SAT+UNSAT training with closest assignment supervision yields the lowest average gap (0.98).",
        "Models trained on SR40 maintain reasonable effectiveness on SR100 and 3SAT100, demonstrating cross-distribution applicability, though with expected performance degradation."
