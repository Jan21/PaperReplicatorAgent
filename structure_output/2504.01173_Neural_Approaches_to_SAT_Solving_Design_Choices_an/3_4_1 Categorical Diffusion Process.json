    "Diffusion models are trained to denoise noisy versions of samples; for SAT problems, samples are binary variable assignments.",
    "The forward diffusion process corrupts the initial assignment over T timesteps via a Markov chain with transition matrices defined by a noise schedule β_t.",
    "The transition matrix Q_t for categorical diffusion is defined for Boolean variables, and as t approaches T, the distribution of assignments becomes uniform.",
    "Cumulative transition matrices Q̄_t simplify inference, allowing efficient sampling of x_t given x_0 using a categorical distribution."
