        "Two benchmark generators are used: the SR generator and a 3-SAT generator set near the phase transition ratio.",
        "The SR generator creates formula pairs (satisfiable/unsatisfiable) differing by a single literal flip, preventing models from relying on superficial statistical features.",
        "The 3-SAT generator creates problems at the critical clause-to-variable ratio of 4.26, where instances are empirically most challenging.",
        "SR generator uses a solver-driven approach, iteratively adding random clauses until unsatisfiability is reached, then creates a satisfiable counterpart.",
        "3-SAT focuses on natural problem difficulty, with each clause containing exactly 3 literals selected uniformly from variables."
