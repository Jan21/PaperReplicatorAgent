        "Training datasets consist of 50,000 instances: 25,000 pairs for SR and 50,000 instances for 3-SAT, with variations based on variable count ranges (e.g., SR40: 3-40 vars, SR100: 10-100 vars).",
        "The SR dataset is designed to prevent models from exploiting statistical shortcuts, forcing them to learn genuine logical reasoning for SAT/UNSAT prediction.",

        "The section provides a table of benchmark statistics including SAT percentage, average Gap, SAT Gap, UNSAT Gap, and average clauses for several dataset variants."
