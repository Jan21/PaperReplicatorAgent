  "key_points": [
    "Evaluations are reported with fixed diffusion steps and varying message-passing steps (Table 10) and vice versa (Table 9).",
    "Increasing the number of iterative steps (either message-passing or diffusion) does not always lead to performance benefits.",
    "When one type of step is fixed, increasing the other beyond a certain threshold does not improve performance."
