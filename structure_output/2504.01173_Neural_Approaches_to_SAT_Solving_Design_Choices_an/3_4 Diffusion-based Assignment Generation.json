        "Diffusion models are a powerful generative modeling approach that transforms a simple noise distribution into a complex target distribution.",
        "For practical applications, diffusion models are typically conditioned on an input to generate samples with specific characteristics.",
        "In the context of this paper, the diffusion model will be conditioned on the bipartite graph representing a CNF formula.",
        "The section foreshadows that the GNNs used in the paper will be extended to diffusion models later (in Section 5.4)."
