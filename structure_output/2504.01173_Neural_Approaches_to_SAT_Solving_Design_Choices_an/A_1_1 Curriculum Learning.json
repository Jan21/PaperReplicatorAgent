    "key_points": [
        "Curriculum learning trains with simpler (smaller) formulas first to establish basic logical reasoning before progressing.",
        "The strategy uses increasing formula size as the curriculum metric, starting from 5 variables and progressing to 40 variables.",
        "A validation accuracy threshold must be met (or a maximum epoch limit reached) before moving to the next formula size.",
        "When introducing a new formula size, the training set includes formulas from the four previous sizes to prevent catastrophic forgetting.",
        "This curriculum approach significantly accelerates training, reducing training time from over 5 hours to approximately 30 minutes to reach 85% validation accuracy."
