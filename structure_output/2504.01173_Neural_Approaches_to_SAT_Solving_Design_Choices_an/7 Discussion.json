        "The primary limitation is that GNN-based methods are not competitive with state-of-the-art SAT solvers on real-world problems with millions of variables.",
        "Test-time scaling experiments show GNNs can generalize beyond their training distribution and do not merely learn superficial patterns.",
        "The trained GNN functions as an implicit MaxSAT solver, incrementally maximizing satisfied clauses through continuous updates similar to gradient descent.",
        "Future work aims to manually derive the GNN's update equations using a primal-dual approach, interpreting it as optimizing a continuous relaxation of MaxSAT.",
        "Developing data-driven numerical solvers analogous to physics-informed neural networks is proposed as an exciting future direction for combinatorial optimization."
