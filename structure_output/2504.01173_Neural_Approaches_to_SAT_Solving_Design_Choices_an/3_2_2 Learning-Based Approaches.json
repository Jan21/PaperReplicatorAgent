        "Machine learning is heavily used in SAT solving, with approaches falling into two main categories: those that guide traditional solvers and those that solve SAT problems directly (end-to-end).",
        "Neural networks can replace traditional solver heuristics (e.g., variable selection, restart policies) when guiding a solver.",
        "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can be trained to solve SAT problems end-to-end by operating on a bipartite graph representation of Boolean formulas (variables and clauses as nodes).",
        "This work focuses on recurrent GNN variants, which allow computational scaling during inference and adaptive iteration counts per instance.",
        "The end-to-end ML approaches (specifically the GNNs in this work) can be interpreted as bi-level optimization methods: the outer loop trains network weights, and the inner loop (during inference) optimizes variable assignments to maximize satisfied clauses."
