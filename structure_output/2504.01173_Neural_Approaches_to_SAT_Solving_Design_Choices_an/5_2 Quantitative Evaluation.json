        "Explains that Average Gap measures average unsatisfied clauses across all instances, with lower values (0 for SAT instances) indicating better performance.",
        "Clarifies that SAT Accuracy is the percentage of satisfiable instances where a satisfying assignment is found.",
        "Describes Decision Accuracy as the percentage of instances correctly classified as satisfiable or unsatisfiable, with a specific operational definition for unsatisfiable instances.",
        "Notes that for unsatisfiable instances, the model's performance reflects how close it gets to minimizing unsatisfied clauses since formal refutation isn't performed."
