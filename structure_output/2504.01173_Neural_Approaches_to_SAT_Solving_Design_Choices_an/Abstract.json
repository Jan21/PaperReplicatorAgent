        "Finds that variable-clause graph representations with recurrent neural network updates achieve good SAT assignment prediction accuracy with reduced computational demands.",
        "Extends the base GNN into a diffusion model that enables incremental sampling and can be combined with classical techniques like unit propagation.",
