        "The SDP solution can be visualized as positioning unit vectors, where vectors for variables to be set TRUE move closer to a reference vector y0, and vectors for FALSE variables move away from it.",
        "For satisfiable formulas, the objective function drives vectors to form two well-separated clusters; for unsatisfiable or hard-to-satisfy formulas, vectors become scattered.",
        "A simple rounding scheme assigns Boolean values based on the sign of the inner product ⟨y0, yi⟩. A random hyperplane rounding yields a provable 0.8785 approximation guarantee for the MAX-2-SAT optimum.",
        "Satisfiability can be checked by verifying if the SDP objective reaches the total number of clauses in the formula, allowing the SDP formulation to act as an incomplete SAT solver.",
        "For MAX-SAT with larger clauses (beyond 2-SAT), empirical observation indicates the SDP convergence threshold must be decreased significantly to obtain good approximations."
