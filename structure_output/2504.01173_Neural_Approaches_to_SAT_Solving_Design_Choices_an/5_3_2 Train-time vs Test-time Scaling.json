  "section_purpose": "To compare the performance of models trained on different problem size distributions when evaluated on benchmarks of varying sizes, and to analyze the trade-offs between training on larger instances versus using test-time scaling.",
  "key_points": [
    "Models trained on smaller instances (SR40) can generalize to larger problems, but performance degrades as problem size increases.",
    "Models trained on larger instances (SR100) generalize better to even larger problems (SR200) compared to models trained on smaller instances.",
    "Test-time scaling (increasing inference steps/computation) has limits, and optimal performance on very large problems may require training on larger instances.",
    "Recurrent GNN architectures offer a flexible tradeoff between computation and performance that can be adjusted at inference time."
