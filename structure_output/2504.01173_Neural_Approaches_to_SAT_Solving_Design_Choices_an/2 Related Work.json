    "key_points": [
        "The work builds directly on NeuroSAT, an end-to-end neural SAT solver using a recurrent message-passing architecture, and explores simplified variants and training improvements like curriculum learning.",
        "Other neural SAT approaches include G4SATBench (benchmarking various GNN architectures) and hybrid methods like NeuroCore/NeuroComb that integrate neural networks with traditional CDCL solvers.",
        "The connection between neural networks and continuous relaxations is highlighted, with FourierSAT transforming SAT into continuous optimization and other works linking GNNs to semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations.",
        "The paper distinguishes its focus on the recurrent message-passing paradigm from NeuroSAT, investigating specific training objectives and graph representations, as opposed to broader architecture exploration or hybrid solving."
