  "key_points": [
    "The GNN can serve as a function approximator in a diffusion model, enabling scalable test-time computation by predicting ground truth solutions from noisy samples.",
    "The diffusion process involves iterative prediction and sampling over time steps, with the number of diffusion steps (T) being a tunable parameter post-training.",
    "Two types of iterations exist: message-passing steps (GNN_Steps) and diffusion steps, with experiments showing message-passing steps are more critical for performance metrics like accuracy and average gap.",
    "Experimental results demonstrate performance across benchmarks (e.g., SR40, SR100) and highlight the impact of training on larger instances for better generalization.",
    "Tables and figures provide quantitative evaluations, including decision accuracy, SAT/UNSAT instance solving rates, and iteration efficiency."
