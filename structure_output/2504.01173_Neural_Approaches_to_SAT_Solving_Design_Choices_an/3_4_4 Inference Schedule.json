    "key_points": [
        "During inference, the number of denoising steps can differ from training: fewer steps accelerate generation, while more steps may improve output quality.",
        "The sequence of time steps used during inference is called a schedule, typically represented as (T, T-1, ..., t_0).",
        "Standard diffusion models condition their function approximator on both the noisy sample and the time step (f_θ(x_t, t)), but the authors' model does not require time step conditioning.",
        "Because time step conditioning is unnecessary in their approach, their inference schedule is defined solely by the number of time steps used."
