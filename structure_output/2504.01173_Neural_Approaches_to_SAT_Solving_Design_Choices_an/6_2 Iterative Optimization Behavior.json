  "key_points": [
    "GNNs solve SAT problems through progressive local refinement, where the number of unsatisfied clauses decreases following a trajectory typical of iterative optimization methods: rapid initial improvement followed by gradual refinement.",
    "The behavior suggests GNNs implicitly learn to perform continuous optimization similar to SDP relaxations for SAT, but the implicit objective function is non-convex, leading to potential local optima and sensitivity to initialization.",
    "Analysis of trajectory data supports the potential value of early stopping techniques, as in some cases the gap at later iterations can be higher than previously achieved minimums.",
    "The network's generalization ability is explained by a bi-level optimization perspective: message passing performs inner optimization (finding variable assignments) guided by network parameters optimized during training."
