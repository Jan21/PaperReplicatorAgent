        "The section surveys multiple supervision objectives for training SAT-solving models, including satisfiability classification, unsupervised training via clause validity, and assignment prediction.",
        "It introduces a novel 'Closest Assignment Training' method where a MaxSAT solver finds a valid assignment minimizing Hamming distance to the model's prediction, adapting the supervision signal to the model's current state.",
        "The authors reimplement objectives from prior work (NeuroSAT, etc.) and also experiment with SAT-only instance filtering, finding it can improve model accuracy.",
        "Different loss functions (Binary Cross-Entropy, Mean Squared Error, Cross-Entropy) are used depending on the prediction task (satisfiability classification vs. assignment prediction).",
        "The novel Closest Assignment Training method is particularly beneficial when the solution space is large, as it avoids penalizing the model for predicting a valid solution different from a precomputed ground truth."
