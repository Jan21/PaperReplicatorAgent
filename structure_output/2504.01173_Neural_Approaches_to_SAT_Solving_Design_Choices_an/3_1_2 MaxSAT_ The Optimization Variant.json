    "MaxSAT is the optimization version of SAT, aiming to maximize the number of satisfied clauses, especially useful when a formula is unsatisfiable.",
    "MaxSAT has variants: unweighted (all clauses equal), weighted (clauses have positive weights), and partial (hard clauses must be satisfied, soft clauses have weights).",
    "The paper focuses exclusively on the unweighted MaxSAT formulation.",
    "Formally, unweighted MaxSAT seeks an assignment that maximizes the sum of indicator functions for satisfied clauses in a CNF formula."
