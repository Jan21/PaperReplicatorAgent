  "key_points": [
    "Boolean satisfiability (SAT) is a fundamental problem that asks whether a Boolean formula has a satisfying assignment with variables taking values from {0,1}.",
    "Formulas are built from propositional variables and logical connectives (conjunction, disjunction, negation), with conjunctive normal form (CNF) being the most common representation.",
    "A CNF formula is a conjunction of clauses, each clause a disjunction of literals, and any Boolean formula can be transformed into an equisatisfiable CNF formula.",
    "An assignment satisfies a CNF formula if at least one literal in each clause evaluates to true under the assignment.",
    "SAT is a special case of Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs), where variables are Boolean and constraints are clauses, as referenced in Brailsford et al. [1999]."
