        "G4SATBench contains 7 datasets from three domains: random problems (SR, 3-SAT), pseudo-industrial problems (CA, PS models), and combinatorial problems (k-Clique, k-Dominating Set, k-Vertex Cover translations).",
        "Each dataset has three difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard) defined by increasing instance sizes (e.g., for SR: 10-40, 40-200, and 200-400 variables, respectively).",
        "Data splits: 80k training, 10k validation, and 10k test pairs for easy/medium datasets; 10k test pairs only for hard datasets.",
        "Generation parameters are chosen to avoid trivial cases, e.g., random 3-SAT formulas are generated at the phase-transition region, and k-Clique problems use a specific Erdős-Rényi graph parameterization.",
        "Dataset diversity and controlled difficulty levels enable fine-grained analysis of GNN performance across different SAT problem types and complexities."
