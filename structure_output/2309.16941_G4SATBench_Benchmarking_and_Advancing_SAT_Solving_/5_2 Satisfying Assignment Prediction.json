        "Unsupervised training methods generally outperform supervised learning for the satisfying assignment prediction task across most datasets.",
        "The hypothesis for this performance gap is that supervised training biases models to learn a single satisfying solution, whereas unsupervised methods can explore multiple feasible solutions, improving generalization.",
        "The UNS2 loss function demonstrates strong and stable performance across all datasets, while the UNS1 loss can cause training instability and non-convergence for some GNN models.",
        "Performance degradation of supervised models is more pronounced on datasets (like medium CA and PS) where the space of satisfying solutions is larger.",
        "The evaluation is conducted only on satisfiable instances, and more detailed results for other GNN models are provided in an appendix."
