        "All evaluated GNN models (NeuroSAT, GCN, GGNN, GIN) show superior performance on both easy and medium SAT problem datasets for unsat-core variable prediction.",
        "NeuroSAT consistently achieves the best classification accuracy across most of the evaluated datasets.",
        "The primary goal of predicting unsat-core variables is not to solve SAT problems directly, but to provide guidance to enhance the backtracking search process in SAT solvers.",
        "Even imperfect predictions (e.g., with 90% accuracy) have been shown in prior work to be effective for improving the heuristics in modern CDCL-based SAT solvers.",
        "Generalization experiments for this task are detailed in an appendix (C.4)."
