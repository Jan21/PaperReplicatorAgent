        "GNN models trained on datasets with specific combinatorial structures (k-Clique, k-Domset, k-Vercov) struggle to generalize to other problem domains, indicating potential overfitting to dataset-specific graph features.",
        "Different inference/decoding algorithms for extracting assignments from learned embeddings show similar performance, suggesting the standard readout is sufficient and that models successfully learn assignment-relevant latent structures.",
