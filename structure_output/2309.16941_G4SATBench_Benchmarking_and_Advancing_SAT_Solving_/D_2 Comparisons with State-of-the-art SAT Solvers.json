  "section_purpose": "This section compares the performance of the GNN-based NeuroSAT model with two state-of-the-art SAT solvers, CaDiCaL (CDCL) and Sparrow (local search), on the G4SATBench datasets under constrained and unconstrained settings, evaluating solving accuracy and runtime.",
  "key_points": [
    "NeuroSAT is compared against the CDCL solver CaDiCaL and the local search solver Sparrow to evaluate GNN-based heuristics against advanced traditional solvers.",
    "For a fair comparison, Sparrow is configured with a maximum flip limit of 32 (Sparrow*) to match the number of assignments generated by NeuroSAT, enabling direct comparison of accuracy and runtime.",
    "Results show that under constrained settings (limited flips), NeuroSAT outperforms Sparrow in generating satisfying assignments more quickly across most G4SATBench datasets.",
    "When unconstrained, both Sparrow and CaDiCaL can solve all satisfiable instances in G4SATBench, while NeuroSAT struggles due to limited exploration capacity.",
    "Despite not outperforming traditional solvers in unconstrained settings, NeuroSAT's assignment predictions could serve as effective initializations for these solvers, potentially improving their performance."
