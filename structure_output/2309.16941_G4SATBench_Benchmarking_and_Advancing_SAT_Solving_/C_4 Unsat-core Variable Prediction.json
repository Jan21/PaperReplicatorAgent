        "NeuroSAT and GGNN exhibit strong generalization ability on unsat-core variable prediction when trained on easy or medium-difficulty datasets, performing well across a range of problem complexities.",
        "Both models demonstrate good generalization to datasets different from their training data, except for the CA (Circuit Analysis) dataset.",
        "The performance discrepancy on the CA dataset is attributed to its specific characteristic of having significantly fewer unsat-core variables compared to variables not in the core, unlike other datasets where unsat-core variables are more numerous.",
        "The variation in distribution of unsat-core to non-core variables between datasets presents a generalization challenge for the models."
