        "Using random initialization (emulating LS solvers) has limited impact on GNN performance, indicating GNNs don't learn fixed formula representations but exploit graph structure.",
        "Analysis of predicted assignments shows GNNs initially flip many variables to reduce unsatisfiable clauses, then converge to minimal changes, resembling the greedy strategy of LS solvers like GSAT.",
        "Unlike GSAT (which flips one variable with random tie-breaking), GNNs modify multiple variables simultaneously and can get stuck on unsatisfying assignments.",
        "NeuroSAT*, even when trained only for satisfiability prediction, shows similar assignment-search behavior, implying GNNs implicitly learn to search for satisfying assignments during training.",
        "The section connects to further experiments in Appendix D.2 comparing GNNs against state-of-the-art CDCL and LS solvers to evaluate their practical viability."
