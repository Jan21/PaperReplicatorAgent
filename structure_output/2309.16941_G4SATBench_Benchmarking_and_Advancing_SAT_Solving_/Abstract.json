        "GNNs are promising for SAT solving but lack unified datasets and fair benchmarks for evaluation.",
        "The paper introduces G4SATBench, the first comprehensive benchmark study for GNN-based SAT solvers.",
        "G4SATBench includes a large, diverse set of SAT datasets (7 problems, 3 difficulty levels) and benchmarks various GNN models across multiple tasks.",
        "The study compares GNN solving processes with traditional SAT solver heuristics to understand their learning abilities.",
        "Key finding: Existing GNN models can learn strategies similar to greedy local search but struggle to learn backtracking search in latent space."
