  "key_points": [
    "GNN models achieve high classification accuracy on easy and medium datasets when trained and evaluated on the same distribution, except for the medium SR dataset which is challenging due to subtle differences between satisfiable and unsatisfiable instances.",
    "NeuroSAT (on LCG*) and GGNN (on VCG*) are the top-performing models in same-distribution evaluation, while different graph constructions do not significantly impact results.",
    "GNN models struggle to generalize to datasets distinct from their training data in most cases, but show better generalization when trained on the SR dataset.",
    "Generalization performance is influenced by dataset nature and complexity, with training on more challenging instances potentially improving ability."
