        "Both NeuroSAT and GGNN models show limited generalization to SAT instances larger than those seen in training, but perform relatively better on smaller instances.",
        "Training on more challenging instances could potentially improve model generalization and performance on larger instances.",
        "Using a training iteration value of 32 for message passing consistently yielded the best performance for both models.",
        "Training with too small or too large iteration values degraded performance.",
        "Models trained with 32 iterations demonstrated good generalization to testing with different iteration counts (16 and 64), highlighting the importance of selecting appropriate message-passing iterations."
