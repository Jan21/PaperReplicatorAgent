  "section_purpose": "To outline the limitations of G4SATBench and propose future research directions for improving GNN-based SAT solving.",
  "key_points": [
    "G4SATBench focuses on standalone neural SAT solvers and excludes neural-guided SAT solvers that integrate GNNs with search-based SAT solvers.",
    "The instances in G4SATBench are smaller than real-world applications, limiting the scalability of GNN models alone.",
    "GNNs show efficacy in unsat-core prediction, suggesting promising integration with modern SAT solvers to scale to real-world instances.",
    "The benchmark does not consider domain-specific GNN models tailored to problems like Circuit SAT, which could improve performance in specialized instances.",
    "Current GNN-based SAT solvers are static and have limited ability to capture the CDCL heuristic; dynamic GNN models are proposed as a future direction."
