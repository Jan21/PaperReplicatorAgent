    "Combinatorial optimization (CO) problems are NP-hard and present significant computational challenges.",
    "Existing large language model (LLM) based approaches for CO often neglect structural priors, leading to suboptimality and inefficiency.",
    "STRCMP is a novel structure-aware LLM-based framework that integrates graph structural priors to improve solution quality and solving efficiency.",
    "The framework combines a graph neural network (GNN) for structural embeddings with an LLM for generating solver-specific codes, using evolutionary refinement for optimization.",
    "Extensive evaluations on Mixed Integer Linear Programming and Boolean Satisfiability problems demonstrate STRCMP's superiority over baseline methods in both optimality and efficiency."
