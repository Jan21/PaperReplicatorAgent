        "The paper uses a two-stage training procedure (GNN first, then LLM conditioned on frozen GNN embeddings) because end-to-end joint training presents significant optimization challenges.",
        "Ablation studies show the full STRCMP model underperforms compared to variants with only SFT or only DPO, suggesting conflicts between optimization objectives during multi-stage post-training.",
        "Future work should investigate domain-specific distributional discrepancies arising from the heterogeneous nature of combinatorial optimization problems to improve post-training alignment.",
        "Future extensions could incorporate additional modal priors beyond graph structure (e.g., dynamic constraint patterns, solution quality metrics) using LLMs' context-aware capabilities.",
        "LLMs could potentially autonomously identify computational bottlenecks through techniques like runtime complexity profiling or constraint violation pattern analysis."
