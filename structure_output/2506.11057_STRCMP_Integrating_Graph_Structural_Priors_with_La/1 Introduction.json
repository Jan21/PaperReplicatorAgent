    "key_points": [
        "Combinatorial optimization problems are NP-hard and critical in many real-world applications, but current solutions require specialized expertise and struggle with computational complexity.",
        "Existing ML approaches for CO (end-to-end neural solvers, ML-augmented configuration, hybrid methods) face limitations in generalization and interpretability that hinder real-world adoption.",
        "Recent LLM-based approaches show promise due to improved interpretability, but primarily rely on textual/visual prompting and fail to exploit the inherent topological structures of CO problems.",
        "Human experts have historically leveraged structural priors to design efficient algorithms, suggesting that integrating structural information could improve LLM-based CO solving.",
        "STRCMP is proposed as a novel framework that explicitly integrates structural priors via GNN-extracted embeddings to guide LLM-based code generation, theoretically motivated by information theory and practical benefits."
