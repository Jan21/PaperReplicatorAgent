  "key_points": [
    "The composite model consists of two components: a GNN implemented with three sequential convolutional layers and global mean pooling, and a structure-prior-aware LLM adapted from Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instructor.",
    "Training involves domain-specific GNN training on SAT (3 epochs) and MILP (4 epochs) benchmark datasets, followed by LLM post-training for 3 epochs per domain, with checkpoint selection based on validation prediction loss.",
    "The adapted model is integrated into an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA)-based framework to discover solver-specific algorithm configurations optimized for training instances.",
    "Experiments are conducted on hardware with dual AMD EPYC 9534 64-core processors and two NVIDIA H800 80GB GPUs, with comprehensive details provided in appendices."
