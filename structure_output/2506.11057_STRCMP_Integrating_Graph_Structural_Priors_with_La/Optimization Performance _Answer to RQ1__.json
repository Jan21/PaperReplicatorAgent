        "STRCMP with various post-training variants consistently matches or exceeds all baseline performance across both SAT and MILP domains.",
        "For SAT problems, STRCMP shows universal superiority over AutoSAT, achieving significant reductions in timeout instances and solving time.",
        "On MILP benchmarks, STRCMP maintains strong performance parity with NCO methods (L2B/HEM) and its direct competitor LLM4Solver.",
        "Specific timeout reductions: 77.8% on Zamkeller (18→4) and 66.7% on PRP (9→3).",
        "The empirical findings conclusively address RQ1, confirming STRCMP successfully identifies superior algorithmic configurations."
