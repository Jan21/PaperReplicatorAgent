  "key_points": [
    "Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) encompasses end-to-end solvers, ML-augmented algorithm configuration, and hybrid methods, but suffers from scalability issues with large problem sizes and lack of interpretability due to opaque models.",
    "Pointer Networks use attention mechanisms for CO problems but struggle with generalization to extreme problem sizes, a common limitation in neural solver architectures.",
    "Language Models (LLMs) are applied to CO via direct solution generation (e.g., OPRO) or automated solver-compatible code generation (e.g., FunSearch, EoH), but often ignore structural characteristics of CO problems.",
    "Evolutionary frameworks combined with LLMs, such as FunSearch and Evolution of Heuristics (EoH), require multiple iterations and incur high computational overhead from repeated solver evaluations.",
    "The proposed approach integrates graph structural priors to enhance solution quality and efficiency, providing interpretability through solver-executable code generation, addressing gaps in NCO and LLM-based methods."
