It reports key metrics (PAR-2 score and Solving Time) and references convergence and ablation study figures.",
    "key_points": [
        "Presents optimization performance results for SAT domain benchmarks (CNP, CoinsGrid, PRP, Zamkeller) comparing STRCMP variants against AutoSAT and EasySAT.",
        "Reports two key metrics: PAR-2 Score (lower is better) and Solving Time (lower is better) for each method and dataset.",
        "Shows STRCMP (full method) generally achieves competitive or best performance, particularly notable on Zamkeller dataset with significantly better PAR-2 (270.62) and Solving Time (7990).",
        "Provides results for STRCMP ablation variants: DPO Only, SFT Only, and without GNN, highlighting the contribution of different components.",
        "References convergence comparison figures (Fig 8-10, 12) and ablation study figures (Fig 11) that visualize performance across iterations/evolution and component importance."
