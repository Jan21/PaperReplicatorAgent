        "The MILP evaluation uses three difficulty categories (Easy, Medium, Hard) defined by the time required for the SCIP 8.0.0 solver to find optimal solutions.",

        "The Medium dataset combines the MIK (MILPs with knapsack constraints) and CORLAT (real-world grizzly bear corridor planning) problems with an 80/20 train/test split and a 120-second time limit.",
        "The Hard dataset contains Load Balancing instances from the NeurIPS 2021 ML4CO competition, modeling server task allocation, with an 80/20 split and a 360-second time limit.",
