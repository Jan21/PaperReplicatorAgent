        "The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is fundamental, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been used for approximate solving.",
        "Typical GNN-based solvers make concurrent predictions, which is guaranteed to fail for symmetric SAT problems due to neglecting variable dependencies.",
        "The paper proposes AsymSAT, a novel GNN architecture integrating Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to generate dependent predictions for variable assignments.",
        "Experimental results show that dependent variable prediction extends GNN-based solving capability and improves the number of solved SAT instances on large test sets."
