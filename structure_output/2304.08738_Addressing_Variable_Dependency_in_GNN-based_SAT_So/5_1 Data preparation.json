    "Three datasets are prepared: small-scale symmetric AIGs, medium-size CNF formulas (SR(n) problems), and large random AIGs (V(n) problems).",
    "The small-scale dataset is manually constructed with 10 circuits having symmetric inputs but asymmetric solutions, designed to test existing methods like NeuroSAT and DG-DAGRNN.",
    "Medium-size datasets (SR(n)) are generated similarly to prior work and converted to circuit form using Shannon's Decomposition.",
    "Large-scale datasets (V(n)) are generated using the AIGEN tool, extracting combinational circuits from sequential ones, and are complex with over 1K logic gates for V(10) problems."
