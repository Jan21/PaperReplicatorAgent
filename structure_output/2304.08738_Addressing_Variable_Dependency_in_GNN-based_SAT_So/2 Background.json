        "The Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT) is defined as determining if there exists an assignment of Boolean values to variables that makes a given Boolean formula true.",
        "A SAT problem instance can be represented as a Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) formula, which is a conjunction of clauses, where each clause is a disjunction of literals.",
        "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can be applied to SAT solving by modeling the formula as a bipartite graph, where variable nodes and clause nodes are connected based on the literals in the clauses.",
        "Message-passing on this bipartite graph allows variable nodes and clause nodes to update their embeddings based on their neighbors, enabling the GNN to learn correlations between variables and clauses.",
        "Circuit-SAT problems extend this graph representation by converting circuits into And-Inverter Graphs (AIGs), which are then encoded as bipartite graphs using a similar GNN approach, but with additional node types for gates like AND."
