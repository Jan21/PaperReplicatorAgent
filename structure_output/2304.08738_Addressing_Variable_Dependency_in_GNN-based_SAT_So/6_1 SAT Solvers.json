    "key_points": [
        "Machine learning-based SAT solvers are categorized into two main types: end-to-end solvers that directly predict SAT outcomes, and solvers that use ML only as heuristics to guide classic algorithms.",
        "The paper's AsymSAT method belongs to the end-to-end category, alongside NeuroSAT and DG-DAGRNN.",
        "Examples of heuristic-based ML solvers include NeuroCore (uses GNN for variable selection) and NLocal-SAT (uses GNN to predict an initial solution for stochastic local search).",
        "Other supporting techniques for SAT solving include QuerySAT (using multiple queries) and domain transfer methods.",
        "The paper argues that its technique for addressing variable dependency is general and could potentially benefit both categories of neural SAT solvers, not just end-to-end ones."
