  "section_purpose": "To introduce the Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT), including its definition, common representations (conjunctive normal form and circuits), and methods for converting formulas, setting the foundation for understanding GNN-based SAT solving.",
  "key_points": [
    "SAT involves deciding if assignments exist to Boolean variables to make a propositional logic formula true, with outcomes being satisfiable (SAT) or unsatisfiable (UNSAT).",
    "SAT inputs are typically in conjunctive normal form (CNF), where literals form clauses with disjunctions (∨), and clauses are connected with conjunctions (∧).",
    "Tseitin transformation converts arbitrary Boolean formulas to equi-satisfiable CNF with a linear size increase relative to the number of operators.",
    "SAT can also be represented as circuits, which are directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) with nodes for inputs, logic gates, and outputs, convertible to and from CNF."
