        "The proposed AsymSAT model, with either an LSTM or GRU-based bidirectional RNN layer, achieves near-perfect accuracy (100%) on symmetric circuit problems, significantly outperforming NeuroSAT and DG-DAGRNN which fail on these problems.",
        "The bidirectional RNN layer (the ℛ layer) is crucial for breaking symmetry; removing it prevents effective training on symmetric circuits.",
        "On the V(n) problem set, AsymSAT maintains moderate solution rates (45-81%), while NeuroSAT fails completely and DG-DAGRNN performs comparably or better in some cases.",
        "Increasing the number of message-passing iterations from 5 to 10 significantly improves accuracy for AsymSAT (especially with GRU), with diminishing returns beyond 10-15 iterations.",
        "AsymSAT with LSTM shows slightly better potential accuracy and a later performance peak (around 15 iterations) compared to GRU, leading to its selection for subsequent SAT-solving experiments."
