        "Preferential Labeling breaks ties between symmetric variables by assigning distinct initial embeddings to variables.",
        "The biased initialization introduces artifacts, requiring evaluation under multiple random permutations of initial embeddings during training and inference to smooth them out.",
        "During training, it selects the permutation yielding the lowest loss for optimization; during inference, it averages outputs across permutations.",
        "The authors position their method (from Section 4) as a lower-cost solution for tie-breaking compared to Preferential Labeling.",
        "A detailed performance and cost comparison with Preferential Labeling is provided in the appendix."
