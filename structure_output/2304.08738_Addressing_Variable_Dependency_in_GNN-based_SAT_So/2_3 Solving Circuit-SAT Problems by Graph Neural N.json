        "The DG-DAGRNN model uses one-hot vectors to encode node types (logic gate or circuit input) as GNN inputs.",
        "Message-passing in DG-DAGRNN is topologically ordered and sequential (forward and backward passes), unlike NeuroSAT's concurrent updates.",
        "Both NeuroSAT and DG-DAGRNN fail to consider variable dependency, leading to incorrect predictions on symmetric graphs."
