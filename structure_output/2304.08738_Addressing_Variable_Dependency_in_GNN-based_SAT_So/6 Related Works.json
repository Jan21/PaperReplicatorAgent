    "The paper distinguishes its focus on variable dependency from traditional symmetry breaking techniques in SAT solving.",
    "It reviews GNN-based SAT solving methods, noting they often lack explicit mechanisms for handling variable dependency.",
    "It connects the concept of variable dependency to ideas like functional dependency and symmetry in classical SAT solving."
