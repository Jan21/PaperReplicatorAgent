    "key_points": [
        "The paper concludes that a neural network heuristic for branching can be trained via supervised learning on the outputs of traditional SAT solvers.",
        "The trained neural heuristic is shown to be competitive with and can outperform traditional hand-crafted branching heuristics on specific problem distributions.",
        "A key limitation identified is that the heuristic's effectiveness diminishes when the test problem distribution differs from the training distribution.",
        "Future work should focus on developing heuristics that are more robust and generalize better across different problem types.",
        "Another future direction is to integrate the learned heuristics into a complete, end-to-end neural SAT solver."
