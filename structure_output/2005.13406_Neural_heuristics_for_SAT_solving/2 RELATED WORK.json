    "key_points": [
        "NeuroSAT [SLB+18] is a key inspiration; it uses a message-passing network to directly generate variable assignments, whereas this paper uses a similar network to guide a backtracking-based algorithm.",
        "FormulaNet [TWTD17] uses a more general graph representation for higher-order logic but hasn't been applied to neural guidance.",
        "PossibleWorldNet [ESA+18], based on TreeNN, explores multiple possible worlds, an approach considered as an alternative to structured backtracking algorithms like DPLL/CDCL.",
        "EqNet [ACKS16] solves Boolean expression equivalence but is limited to very small formulas (~10 variables), while this work tackles formulas with hundreds of variables and thousands of symbols.",
        "Other approaches include Learned Restart Policy [LOM+18], which uses ML to decide when to restart the search, and reinforcement learning [VLV+20] for training clause deletion heuristics in DPLL solvers."
