  "section_purpose": "To introduce the Boolean satisfiability problem, motivate the need for machine learning-based solver selection due to structural differences in SAT instances, critique existing feature-based methods, and present the GraSS approach using graph neural networks with expert knowledge.",
  "key_points": [
    "SAT is a fundamental NP-complete problem with applications in planning, verification, and circuit design.",
    "Solver selection is critical because different solvers perform better on different instances, motivating data-driven approaches.",
    "Existing methods like SATzilla use fixed-dimensional features, limiting their ability to capture complete instance information.",
    "GraSS proposes the first GNN-based method, using literal-clause graphs with hand-designed features and positional encodings for full instance representation.",
    "Contributions include novel architecture, features, runtime-sensitive loss, and state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks."
