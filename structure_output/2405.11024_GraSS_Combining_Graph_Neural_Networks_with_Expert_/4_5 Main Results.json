    "GraSS outperforms baselines in average runtime and percentage of problems solved within a 500s cutoff.",
    "GraSS exhibits improved robustness to selection errors, with lower runtime penalties when mistakes are made.",

    "GraSS performs better on hard instances, while SATzilla12 excels on easy instances.",
    "Feature computation time for GraSS is competitive, with faster times on the LEC dataset compared to some baselines."
