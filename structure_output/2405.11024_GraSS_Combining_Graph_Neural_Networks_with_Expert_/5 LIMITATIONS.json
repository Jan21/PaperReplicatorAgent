    "Deep learning methods like GNNs are data-hungry and require large training sets for optimal performance.",
    "In scenarios with limited data, the performance may not be competitive against simpler models.",
    "The method cannot be readily adapted to online learning due to the need for runtime labels on every solver per instance and the challenge of adapting GNNs to online learning."
