        "Multiple graphical representations of SAT instances exist for GNNs, including lossless (LCG, VCG) and lossy (LIG, VIG) formats, which balance graph size with information content.",
        "GNNs have been used to learn heuristics within SAT solvers: one approach uses VCGs and an MDP framework to select variable signs to flip in local search; another uses VCGs with a DQN architecture to learn branching heuristics in CDCL solvers.",
        "End-to-end satisfiability prediction models like NeuroSAT use LCGs and message-passing to produce a satisfiability probability, achieving reported accuracy on specific synthetic distributions.",
        "GNNs are also employed for SAT instance generation, using representations like LCGs or weighted co-occurrence graphs to drive iterative generation processes.",
        "This body of work provides a foundation for applying GNNs to SAT-related tasks but does not specifically address the problem of solver selection, which is the focus of the current paper."
