        "SAT solver selection is framed as a specific instance of the general algorithm selection problem, which is crucial for computationally hard problems where no single algorithm dominates.",
        "Algorithm selection methods are categorized into offline (training on a dataset beforehand) and online (improving selection dynamically during runtime) approaches.",
        "Online methods (e.g., based on reinforcement learning) avoid initial training costs and distribution shift issues but start with worse performance than offline methods.",
        "The design of algorithm selection systems involves many complex choices, and tools like AutoFolio exist to automate the configuration of such frameworks.",
        "Algorithm selection techniques have been successfully applied to other domains like Answer Set Programming (ASP) and the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP)."
