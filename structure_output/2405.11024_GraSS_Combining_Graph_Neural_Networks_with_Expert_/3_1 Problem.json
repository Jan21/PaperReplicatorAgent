    "The problem is defined as selecting one solver from a fixed pool of K solvers for a given SAT instance to minimize runtime.",
    "Training uses a dataset of SAT instances with sampled solving times from all K solvers for each instance.",
    "The model is trained offline in a supervised manner and then used at test time to select solvers for new instances.",
    "Performance is benchmarked by the average runtime of selected solvers over test instances."
