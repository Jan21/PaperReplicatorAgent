    "key_points": [
        "The loss function is unsupervised and multi-objective, combining a primary task loss and a shared representation constraint loss, eliminating the need for labeled training data.",
        "The primary task loss is a differentiable relaxation of the Weighted MaxSAT objective, where clause satisfaction is represented as a continuous probability and weighted by clause importance.",
        "The shared representation constraint loss encourages positive and negative literal nodes to develop distinct feature representations in the penultimate network layer.",
        "The total loss is a weighted sum of the two components, with a balancing hyperparameter λ controlling their relative importance.",
        "The authors argue that unsupervised learning is better suited for Weighted MaxSAT than supervised approaches due to multiple satisfying assignments and non-uniform clause weight distributions."
