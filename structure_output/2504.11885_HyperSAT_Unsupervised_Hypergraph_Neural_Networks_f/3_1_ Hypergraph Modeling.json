        "A Weighted MaxSAT instance is uniquely mapped to a hypergraph where literals become nodes and clauses become hyperedges.",
        "Each variable is represented by two distinct nodes: one for its positive literal and one for its negative literal.",
        "The weight of each clause in the problem becomes the weight of the corresponding hyperedge in the graph.",
        "This hypergraph modeling captures higher-order dependencies between literals, overcoming limitations of pairwise factor graphs.",
        "Modeling literals (not just variables) as distinct nodes is crucial for accurately representing the logical relationships central to MaxSAT."
