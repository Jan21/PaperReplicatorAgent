        "The core problem involves modeling logical constraints, specifically the strong correlation and mutual exclusivity between positive and negative literal nodes (e.g., x and ¬x).",
        "A cross-attention mechanism is introduced to dynamically assign importance weights to relationships between complementary literal pairs, adaptively capturing logical properties and enabling information exchange.",
        "The mechanism is applied after the hypergraph convolution layer, using separate learnable projection matrices for positive and negative literal nodes to generate Query, Key, and Value representations.",
        "The final architecture integrates this cross-attention layer with a LayerNorm, a parallel Feed-Forward Network (FFN), and residual connections, inspired by Vision Transformer design, to stabilize and enhance representations.",
        "The network output is processed through a softmax layer to produce soft node assignments interpreted as class probabilities, specifically the probability of assigning a variable to a truth value."
