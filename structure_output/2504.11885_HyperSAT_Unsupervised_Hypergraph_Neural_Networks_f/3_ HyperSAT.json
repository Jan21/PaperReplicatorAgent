  "key_points": [
    "HyperSAT consists of three modules: hypergraph modeling to represent Weighted MaxSAT instances as hypergraphs, neural network processing for optimization, and probabilistic mapping to convert outputs to Boolean solutions.",
    "The neural network module addresses uneven clause weights by incorporating a cross-attention mechanism to prioritize clause contributions.",
    "An unsupervised multi-objective loss function is introduced to capture logical interplay between positive and negative literal node representations.",
    "The workflow transforms instances into hypergraphs, processes them via the neural network, and maps probabilistic outputs to discrete solutions.",
    "Figure 1 illustrates the complete HyperSAT workflow, integrating all modules."
