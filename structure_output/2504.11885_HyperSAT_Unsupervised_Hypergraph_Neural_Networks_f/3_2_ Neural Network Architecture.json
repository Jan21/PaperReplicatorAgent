    "The HyperSAT neural architecture is composed of three main components: a Hypergraph Convolutional Network (HyperGCN), a transformer module with a cross-attention mechanism, and a softmax layer.",
    "The HyperGCN component is specifically highlighted as a foundational element of the architecture.",
    "A cross-attention mechanism is integrated within the transformer module.",
    "A softmax layer is used, presumably to produce probability distributions over variable assignments or clause satisfactions."
