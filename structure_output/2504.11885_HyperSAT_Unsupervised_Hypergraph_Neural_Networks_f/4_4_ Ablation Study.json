    "section_purpose": "To evaluate the individual contribution of three key components of the HyperSAT model by systematically removing them and measuring the resulting performance drop on Weighted MaxSAT problems.",
    "key_points": [
        "Modeling the Weighted MaxSAT instance as a hypergraph with literal nodes (HGM-L) is the most critical component, as using variable nodes instead causes a performance drop of 52.77%.",
        "The transformer module with cross-attention mechanism is important for capturing dependencies across complementary literals; its removal causes an 11.54% performance drop.",
        "The shared representation constraint loss (SRCL) is crucial for encouraging distinct feature representations for positive and negative literal nodes; its removal leads to worse performance (64.08 vs. 41.64).",
        "The full model with all three components achieves the best performance (41.64), demonstrating the synergistic effect of their integration.",
        "The ablation study validates the design choices by showing that each component contributes significantly to the model's overall effectiveness."
