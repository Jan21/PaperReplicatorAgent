        "Two accuracy metrics are used: gap to optimal objective (difference between predicted and optimal number of satisfied clauses) and accuracy of assignments (percentage of correctly classified variables).",
        "The gap to optimal objective is considered a better indicator since MaxSAT problems can have multiple optimal solutions.",
        "Both models (MS-NSFG and MS-ESFG) converge within 150 epochs and achieve high performance with average gaps less than 2 clauses (>99.5% approximation ratio).",
        "Assignment accuracy is around 92% for Max2SAT and 83% for Max3SAT, with MS-ESFG performing slightly better than MS-NSFG.",
        "Experimental results confirm that both GNN models can effectively learn to solve MaxSAT problems."
