    "key_points": [
        "Traditional combinatorial problem solving relies on symbolic search algorithms, but there are growing data-driven approaches.",
        "One research direction integrates machine learning into traditional search frameworks (e.g., for MIP, SMT, QBF).",
        "This paper focuses on end-to-end models that do not require search algorithm assistance, tracing from early Hopfield networks to modern neural variants.",
        "GNNs are particularly suited for combinatorial problems because many problems are graph-defined, and variable-constraint relations form bipartite graphs.",
        "There is a growing body of GNN-based work for problems like SAT, TSP, pseudo-Boolean optimization, and graph coloring, supported by recent literature reviews."
