  "key_points": [
    "Graph neural networks (GNNs) are promising for solving combinatorial problems like MaxSAT in a data-driven fashion.",
    "Two GNN models, MS-NSFG and MS-ESFG, were developed and achieved high accuracy on randomly generated benchmarks with good generalization to larger, more difficult instances.",
    "The paper provides a theoretical analysis showing that even a single-layer GNN can solve MaxSAT with an approximation ratio of 1/2.",
    "Future work includes integrating GNN models into search frameworks to handle more complex problems such as weighted and partial MaxSAT.",
    "Another future direction is to analyze the theoretical capability of multilayer GNNs for achieving better approximation ratios."
