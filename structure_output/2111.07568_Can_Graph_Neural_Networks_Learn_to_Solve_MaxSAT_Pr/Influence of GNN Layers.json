    "key_points": [
        "The number of GNN layers (T) directly determines how much neighborhood information each node receives, which significantly impacts prediction accuracy.",
        "When T=1, both models perform poorly, with predictions far from optimal values and low assignment accuracy.",
        "Performance improves substantially at T=5, and reaches near-optimal levels (within one satisfied clause on average) at T=20.",
        "Increasing T beyond 20 (up to 60 tested) yields no significant further improvement, indicating diminishing returns beyond a certain depth.",
        "The results validate the theoretical analysis that increasing layers within an appropriate range enhances GNN capability for MaxSAT."
