    "key_points": [
        "SAT and MaxSAT are NP-hard problems with significant applications; traditional solvers use handcrafted search strategies.",
        "Current deep learning approaches to SAT fall into two categories: end-to-end models predicting satisfiability/solutions, and hybrid models improving heuristics within traditional solvers.",
        "A key gap is the lack of analysis on the quality of solutions predicted by GNNs, and the absence of theoretical understanding of why GNNs work for SAT problems.",
        "Theoretical foundations like algorithmic alignment and distributed local algorithms suggest GNNs can approximate solutions for NP-hard problems, providing a basis for analyzing MaxSAT.",
        "This paper investigates GNNs for MaxSAT from both theoretical (designing a distributed local algorithm with 1/2 approximation ratio alignable with GNNs) and practical perspectives (building and evaluating two GNN models)."
