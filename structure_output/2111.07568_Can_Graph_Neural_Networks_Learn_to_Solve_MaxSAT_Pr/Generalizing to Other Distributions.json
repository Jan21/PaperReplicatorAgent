  "section_purpose": "To evaluate the generalization ability of GNN models (MS-NSFG and MS-ESFG) on MaxSAT problems with distributions different from the training data, focusing on three aspects: clause-variable proportion, problem size/difficulty, and parameter k.",
  "key_points": [
    "Focuses on three generalization types: different clause-variable proportions, larger/more difficult problems, and different parameter k (e.g., Max2SAT vs Max3SAT).",
    "Models generalize well when clause-variable proportions are similar, maintaining high accuracy.",
    "Models can handle larger problem sizes, indicating potential for solving difficult MaxSAT instances.",
    "Generalization across different k is limited, with reduced accuracy and larger optimality gaps."
