    "key_points": [
        "Recent work applies GNNs to NP-hard problems like SAT, bridging machine learning and symbolic reasoning, but predicted solution quality is under-investigated.",
        "This paper studies GNNs' capability to solve MaxSAT from both theoretical and practical perspectives.",
        "Two GNN models are built and trained on MaxSAT benchmarks, with experimental evaluation showing attractive potential.",
        "It provides the first theoretical explanation, based on algorithmic alignment theory, for why GNNs can learn to solve MaxSAT to some extent."
