        "Due to the NP-hard nature of MaxSAT and the assumption P ≠ NP, exact polynomial-time algorithms cannot align with GNNs, so the analysis turns to approximation algorithms.",
        "Distributed Local Algorithms (DLAs) are a class of algorithms well-suited for aligning with GNNs for combinatorial problems, as they operate via local computations and message passing in a constant number of synchronous communication rounds.",
        "A specific DLA for MaxSAT is presented (Algorithm 1), which operates on a factor graph representation of the problem (such as NSFG) and assigns truth values based on a simple voting mechanism.",
        "DLAs are used in various applications like designing sublinear-time algorithms and controlling wireless sensor networks, highlighting their practical relevance."
