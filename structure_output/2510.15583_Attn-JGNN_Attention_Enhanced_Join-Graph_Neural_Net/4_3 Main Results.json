  "key_points": [
    "Attn-JGNN achieves more accurate count estimates than NSNet, BPNN, and F2 on the BIRD benchmark, being almost three times more accurate than F2 and BPNN, though it cannot compete with ApproxMC3 in all scenarios.",
    "Attn-JGNN demonstrates effectiveness on large, difficult cases where ApproxMC3 fails (exceeding e^100 ground truth count), with Attn-JGNN still providing close approximations even when counts exceed e^1000.",
    "Even without the attention mechanism, Attn-JGNN outperforms NSNet, indicating the superior reasoning ability of the IJGP algorithm compared to Belief Propagation.",
    "On the SATLIB benchmark (with randomly generated instances), Attn-JGNN still outperforms NSNet and F2 in most categories despite the difficulty in exploiting common features.",
    "Ablation experiments confirm that all three attention mechanisms (hierarchical, constraint perception, and dynamic) contribute positively: hierarchical and constraint perception improve accuracy, while dynamic attention reduces redundant heads and training time."
