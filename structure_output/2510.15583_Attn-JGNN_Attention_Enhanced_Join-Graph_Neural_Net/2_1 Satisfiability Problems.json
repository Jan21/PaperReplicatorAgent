    "A Boolean formula is composed of Boolean variables and logical operators like negation, conjunction, and disjunction.",
    "Boolean formulas are commonly represented in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF), which is a conjunction of clauses, where each clause is a disjunction of literals.",
    "The SAT (Satisfiability Problem) asks whether a variable assignment exists that satisfies a given CNF formula.",
    "The #SAT (Propositional Model Counting Problem) aims to count the total number of satisfying assignments (models) for a CNF formula."
