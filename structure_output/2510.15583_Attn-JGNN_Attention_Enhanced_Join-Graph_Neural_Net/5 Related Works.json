    "key_points": [
        "Traditional #SAT methods are divided into Exact Counting (prioritizing correctness) and Approximate Counting (trading accuracy for scalability).",
        "Exact counting includes Search-based methods (extending DPLL algorithm, e.g., c2d, SharpSAT) and Dynamic Programming-based methods (decomposing formulas recursively, e.g., ADDMC, DPMC), but both face scalability challenges.",
        "Approximate counting, especially hash-based methods like ApproxMC, uses randomization and hash functions to partition the solution space for estimation, offering polynomial-time complexity with provable guarantees.",
        "Neural network approaches leverage GNNs and message-passing to learn from formula structures, starting with NeuroSAT for satisfiability classification and evolving to #SAT with methods like BPNN (combining Belief Propagation) and BPGAT (adding attention).",
        "Existing neural methods (BPNN, BPGAT) show promise in speed and adaptability but have limitations: BPNN relies on BP's inaccuracies on cyclic graphs, and BPGAT suffers from high computational overhead due to global attention."
