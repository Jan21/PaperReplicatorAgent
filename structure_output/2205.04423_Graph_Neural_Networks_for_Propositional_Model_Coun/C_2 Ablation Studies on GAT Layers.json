  "key_points": [
    "Ablation studies assess the benefit of GAT attention in both message directions for the BPGAT model.",
    "Hybrid models were tested: one combining BP with BPGAT (GAT in one direction only) and another combining BPNN with BPGAT.",
    "Results show that BPGAT with full GAT attention outperforms hybrid variants in terms of RMSE and MRE across test datasets.",
    "The studies demonstrate that transforming both message types with GAT attention is crucial for optimal model performance."
