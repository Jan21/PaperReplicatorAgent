  "key_points": [
    "#SAT (counting satisfying assignments of Boolean formulas) is #P-complete and computationally hard, making exact solvers impractical for industrial problems.",
    "Approximate solvers and machine learning approaches, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), offer scalable alternatives without requiring hand-crafted heuristics.",
    "Effective deep learning models for combinatorial tasks should demonstrate scalability, generalization, data-efficiency, and time-efficiency.",
    "The paper extends prior work [15] that used Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) to generalize Belief Propagation (BP) by augmenting the model with a self-attention mechanism to enhance generalization.",
    "The proposed model, trained on small synthetic datasets, scales to larger problems and generalizes across distributions via fine-tuning with minimal labeled data."
