        "Prior work [2] used GNNs for weighted #DNF counting, benefiting from an FPRAS for abundant training data, unlike the authors' limited-data #SAT regime.",
        "GNNs have been applied to NP-complete combinatorial problems like SAT, either as end-to-end solvers [18,22,3] or to learn heuristics within branch-and-bound solvers [30,16].",
        "The authors' architecture builds upon BPNN [15], with key differences in training protocol (random vs. benchmark-derived formulae) and architectural improvements (attention mechanism).",
        "The attentional layer is believed to help the network focus on formula regions more significant for the #SAT problem, improving scalability and generalizability over BPNN."
