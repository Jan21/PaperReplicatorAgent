  "section_title": "B Comparison with BPNN",
  "section_purpose": "To experimentally compare the performance of BPGAT (with GAT-style attention) and BPNN (without attention), demonstrating the improvement due to attention and evaluating scalability and generalization across different training regimes.",
  "key_points": [
    "BPGAT consistently outperforms BPNN in terms of RMSE and MRE across all benchmarks and training scenarios.",
    "BPNN is implemented with 3-layer feedforward networks (ReLU activations) for MLPs from Equation 8, sharing other components like MLP3 and Δ operator with BPGAT.",
    "Three training regimes are compared: fine-tuning on specific distributions, training from scratch with 500 epochs and 250 examples per distribution, and training on random Boolean formulae.",
    "Fine-tuning both models yields better performance than training from scratch on distribution-specific datasets, with BPGAT showing superior generalization.",
    "The experiments confirm that adding a GAT-style attention mechanism enhances model performance and scalability in propositional model counting tasks."
