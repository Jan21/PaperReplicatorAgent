    "key_points": [
        "The optimal damping strategy is to use a learned MLP operator (Δ) only for factor-to-variable messages, while fixing the damping for variable-to-factor messages to 0.5.",
        "Using a learned operator for both message types (BPGAT_ALL) or only for variable-to-factor messages (BPGAT_VF) yields worse performance than the chosen configuration.",
        "The optimal number of message-passing iterations (T) is 5, as performance degrades with more iterations (10 or 15).",
        "Results are presented using RMSE and MRE metrics across three test datasets, with the chosen configuration (BPGAT with T=5) showing the best performance."
