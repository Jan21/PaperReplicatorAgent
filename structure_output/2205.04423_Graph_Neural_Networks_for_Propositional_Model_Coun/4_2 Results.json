        "Fine-tuning a model pre-trained on random Boolean formulae (FT_BPGAT) yields better generalization to new problem distributions (e.g., combinatorial encodings, Network QMR) than training from scratch on the specific dataset (TS_BPGAT).",
        "BPGAT is data-efficient, requiring only 1000 small random CNF formulae for pre-training (~5s to generate), and time-efficient, processing all test instances in ≤3s without GPU acceleration, significantly faster than exact and approximate solvers.",
