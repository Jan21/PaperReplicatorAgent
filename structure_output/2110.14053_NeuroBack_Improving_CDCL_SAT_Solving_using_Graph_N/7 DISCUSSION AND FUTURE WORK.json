        "Identifies two main areas for improvement in NeuroBack: (1) data-intensive GNN pre-training, and (2) static vs. dynamic utilization of neural phase predictions.",
        "Acknowledges that while GNN pre-training requires large datasets, the trained model generalizes well to new problem categories, justifying the data investment.",
        "Highlights that the current work uses neural phase predictions only as initial variable phase settings, but multiple methods exist for their application.",
        "Suggests that leveraging phase predictions dynamically during rephasing could enhance performance by adjusting or diversifying search space exploration.",
        "Notes that the dataset will be made publicly available to benefit future research."
