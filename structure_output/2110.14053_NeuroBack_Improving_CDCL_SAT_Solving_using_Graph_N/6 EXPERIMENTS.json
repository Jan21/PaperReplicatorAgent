    "key_points": [
        "The NeuroBack model achieves 75.1% accuracy in classifying backbone variables after pre-training, with post fine-tuning it achieves over 90% on precision, recall, and F1 score.",
        "Experiments evaluate solving performance on 800 CNF formulas from SATCOMP-2022 and SATCOMP-2023, comparing NeuroBack-Kissat against Default-Kissat and Random-Kissat baselines.",
        "NeuroBack-Kissat consistently outperforms both baselines, showing improvements of 3.0-7.4% in the number of problems solved across the two competition datasets.",
        "Model inference for NeuroBack is performed on CPU with a memory limit of 10GB, taking an average of 1.7 seconds per problem, with some problems failing inference.",
        "Results are visualized via cactus plots, showing NeuroBack-Kissat solves more problems faster, reducing solving time per problem by tens to hundreds of seconds compared to baselines."
