  "section_purpose": "The abstract summarizes the paper's main contributions: introducing NeuroBack, a practical GNN-enhanced CDCL SAT solver that uses offline inference, and presenting DataBack, a dataset for training it, along with performance improvements.",
  "key_points": [
    "SAT is NP-complete and important in many fields, with modern solvers based on CDCL.",
    "Prior GNN enhancements for CDCL solvers have been ineffective or required heavy GPU resources.",
    "NeuroBack introduces two insights: predicting variable phases common in satisfying assignments is key, and a single offline model query suffices.",
    "NeuroBack removes GPU reliance by using offline inference on CPU, is trained on the new DataBack dataset (120,286 samples), and enhances Kissat.",
    "NeuroBack improved Kissat, solving 5.2% and 7.4% more problems on SATCOMP-2022 and SATCOMP-2023 sets, demonstrating practical ML-enhanced SAT solving."
