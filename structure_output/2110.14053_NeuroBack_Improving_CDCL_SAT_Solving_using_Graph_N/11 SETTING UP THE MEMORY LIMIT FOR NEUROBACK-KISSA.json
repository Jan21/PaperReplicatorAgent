    "section_purpose": "To provide practical guidance on configuring memory limits for running NeuroBack-Kissat solver instances, particularly in parallel execution environments, to prevent memory contention issues.",
    "key_points": [
        "The experimental setup uses a machine with 256GB memory running 64 parallel solver instances.",
        "A conservative SAT formula size threshold of 135 MB is set to ensure each instance stays under 10GB memory limit.",
        "This threshold is based on practical experience and prevents memory contention.",
        "Users should adjust thresholds based on their machine's memory capacity.",
        "Alternative approach: set memory threshold per solver instance and allow model inference until threshold is reached (overhead typically < few seconds)."
