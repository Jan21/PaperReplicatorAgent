    "section_purpose": "This section presents a detailed performance comparison between NeuroBack-Kissat and baseline solvers specifically on solved SAT and UNSAT problems, analyzing differential improvement patterns and providing explanations for the observed trends.",
    "key_points": [
        "NeuroBack-Kissat shows better relative improvement rate on UNSAT problems (outperforming Default-Kissat in 62.4% of solved UNSAT problems) than on SAT problems (50.9% outperformance rate).",
        "Despite lower outperformance rate, the magnitude of improvement is greater for SAT problems (average 53.2% enhancement) than for UNSAT problems (average 14.6% enhancement).",
        "NeuroBack's phase predictions help with UNSAT problems by directing search toward unsatisfiable parts of the search space and helping identify assignments that reduce clause falsification.",
        "NeuroBack shows more pronounced improvement on SAT problems because predicted phases can contribute directly to finding complete satisfying assignments, while in UNSAT problems only partial satisfying assignments exist.",
        "The fundamental difference in problem nature (complete vs. partial satisfying assignments) explains the varying effectiveness of NeuroBack's phase predictions across SAT and UNSAT problems."
