        "SAT is defined for formulas in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF), and the goal of a solver is to find a satisfying assignment (SAT) or prove none exists (UNSAT). The concept of backbone variables (variables with consistent phase across all satisfying assignments) is introduced.",
        "The CDCL (Conflict-Driven Clause Learning) algorithm is the backbone of modern SAT solvers, involving variable branching, Boolean propagation, conflict analysis, clause learning, and backtracking.",
        "Phase selection heuristics, like Phase Saving (uses last assigned polarity) and Rephasing (resets/modifies saved phases for diversification), are crucial components in CDCL solvers, with Kissat cited as a state-of-the-art implementation.",
        "GNNs operate on graphs via message-passing layers that iteratively update node feature vectors based on neighbor information.",
        "The Graph Transformer architecture combines GNNs (for local structure) with Transformer self-attention (for global dependencies); GraphTrans is a specific model that inspires NeuroBack's design."
