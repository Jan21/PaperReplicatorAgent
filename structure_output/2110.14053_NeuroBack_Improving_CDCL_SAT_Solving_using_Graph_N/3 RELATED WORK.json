    "key_points": [
        "Identifying a CNF formula's backbone is computationally hard (co-NP complete), and even approximating it is intractable, making direct computation infeasible.",
        "Previous ML approaches (e.g., logistic regression for phase prediction) failed to improve solving time despite high accuracy on backbone variables, and recent works focus on partial backbone computation during solving.",
        "ML techniques for CDCL, including GNNs, often aim to improve branching or phase selection heuristics but show limited effectiveness on large-scale problems with thousands of variables.",
        "NeuroCore is the closest related work, enhancing branching heuristics via online inference on unsat core variables, but its frequent online inference is computationally expensive.",
        "NeuroBack is distinct: it enhances phase selection (not branching) using offline GNN inference to predict backbone variables from sat formulas, aiming for effectiveness on large-scale problems."
