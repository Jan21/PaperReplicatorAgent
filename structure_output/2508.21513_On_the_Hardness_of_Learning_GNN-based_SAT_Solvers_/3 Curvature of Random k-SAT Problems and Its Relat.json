        "Random k-SAT problems are represented as bipartite Literal-Clause Graphs (LCGs) with specific degree distributions for literals and clauses.",
        "As problems become easier (α → 0), the average Ricci curvature (both Ollivier and Balanced Forman) approaches 0, indicating flatter graphs.",
        "As problems become harder (α → ∞), the average lower bound of curvature approaches (2/k - 2), showing increasingly negative curvature.",
        "Theorem 3.1 provides an upper bound for Balanced Forman Curvature (BFC) and shows that as α → ∞, average BFC converges to (2/k - 2).",
        "The parameter k plays a crucial role in determining curvature: larger k leads to more negative curvature for hard problems, indicating more bottlenecks."
