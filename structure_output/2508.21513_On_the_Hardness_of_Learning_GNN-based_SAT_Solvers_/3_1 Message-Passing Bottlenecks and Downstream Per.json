        "Edges with high negative curvature create graph bottlenecks leading to the oversquashing phenomenon in GNNs, which limits information propagation across the graph.",
        "GNN-based SAT solvers suffer from two types of hardness: the algorithmic hardness inherent to SAT problems and the hardness of learning representations for long-range communication due to oversquashing.",
        "For large clause density (α→∞) and large k, highly negatively curved edges are guaranteed to exist on average, causing exponentially decaying gradients in node representations.",
        "Increasing connectivity (α) makes literals more distant on the interaction network, increasing long-range codependencies that fixed-length GNN representations cannot effectively capture.",
        "Even for problems considered simple in terms of α (clause density), increasing k leads to worse oversquashing and worse GNN performance due to k's effect on Balanced Forman Curvature (BFC)."
