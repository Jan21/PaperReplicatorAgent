    "section_purpose": "This section introduces Ricci Curvature (RC) as a measure of local structure in graphs, explains its origins in geometry, and describes two discrete adaptations (Ollivier and Forman) used for analyzing graph neural networks.",
    "key_points": [
        "Ricci Curvature quantifies local deviation from flat space, capturing how neighborhoods relate between adjacent points.",
        "Two primary discrete adaptations exist: Ollivier-Ricci Curvature (OC) based on optimal transport of probability mass, and Forman-Ricci Curvature (FC) based on combinatorial topology.",
        "RC has become important for theoretically analyzing GNN limitations, particularly connecting negative curvature to the oversquashing problem in message passing.",
        "The Balanced Forman Curvature (BFC) is highlighted as central to this paper's analysis."
