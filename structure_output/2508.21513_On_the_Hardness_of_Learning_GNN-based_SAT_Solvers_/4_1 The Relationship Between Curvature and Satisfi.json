        "Experimental results show probability of finding a solution as a function of curvature parameters replicates the SAT/UNSAT phase transition around the critical threshold α_c ≈ 4.267 for 3-SAT.",
        "For random 3-SAT, curvature becomes highly negative and concentrates near the dynamical threshold α_d ≈ 3.927, suggesting a relationship between negative curvature and computational hardness.",
        "Test-time rewiring experiments demonstrate that making testing graphs less curved (via stochastic discrete Ricci flow) improves solver performance without retraining, with largest improvements on 4-SAT problems.",
        "The relationship between curvature and performance is stronger for higher k values (e.g., 4-SAT), which have more negatively curved edges that strongly impact GNN-based solvers.",
        "Smaller improvements are observed on the modular CA dataset that mimics real-world industrial problems, suggesting different curvature characteristics."
