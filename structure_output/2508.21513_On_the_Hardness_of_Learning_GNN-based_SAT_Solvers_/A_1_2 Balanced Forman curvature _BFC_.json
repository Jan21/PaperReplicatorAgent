    "section_purpose": "To define and explain the Balanced Forman Curvature (BFC), an extension of Forman-Ricci curvature designed for graphs, which overcomes limitations of the simple Forman curvature and is used in the paper's analysis of SAT problem hardness.",
    "key_points": [
        "The basic Forman-Ricci Curvature (FC) for an edge (i,j) in a simple graph is defined as κ_G^f(i,j) = 4 - d_i - d_j, which ignores important higher-order structures like triangles and 4-cycles.",
        "Balanced Forman Curvature (BFC) is an extension proposed by Topping et al. that is fast to compute and accurately encodes curvature information by incorporating triangles, 4-cycles, and other combinatorial components.",
        "BFC is defined using three key combinatorial components: the number of triangles based at the edge (♯_Δ(i,j)), the number of 4-cycles (♯_□^i(i,j)), and the complement set Q_i(j).",
        "The BFC formula (Equation 16) combines node degrees, triangle counts, and 4-cycle counts (including the maximal number of 4-cycles traversing a common node, γ_max) into a single curvature measure.",
        "The curvature Ric(i,j) is set to zero if either node has degree 1; otherwise, it is computed using the provided formula, which balances contributions from 1-hop neighbors, triangles, and 4-cycles."
