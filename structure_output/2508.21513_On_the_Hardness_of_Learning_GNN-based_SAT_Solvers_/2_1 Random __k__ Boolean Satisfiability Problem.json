        "The random k-SAT problem involves N binary variables and M clauses, each a disjunction of k literals (variables or their negations).",
        "The problem is expressed in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) and the goal is to find a satisfying assignment for all clauses.",
        "Problem hardness exhibits distinct phases based on the clause density parameter α = M/N.",
        "In the thermodynamic limit, two key transitions occur: the dynamical transition α_d(k) where solutions cluster, and the critical transition α_c(k) where solutions condense into the largest clusters.",
        "These phase transitions significantly impact algorithm performance, making problems with α > α_c(k) extremely difficult for existing solvers when k ≥ 4."
