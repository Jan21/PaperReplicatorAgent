        "GNNs show promise for solving SAT problems but degrade sharply on harder instances, raising questions about architectural limitations.",

        "It proves that bipartite graphs from random k-SAT formulas are inherently negatively curved, and curvature decreases with instance difficulty.",
        "GNN-based SAT solvers suffer from oversquashing, where long-range dependencies cannot be compressed into fixed-length representations.",
        "Empirical validation confirms curvature is both a strong indicator of problem complexity and a predictor of GNN solver performance."
