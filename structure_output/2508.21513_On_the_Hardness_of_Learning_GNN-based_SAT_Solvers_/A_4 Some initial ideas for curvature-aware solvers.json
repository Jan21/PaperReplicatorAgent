        "Proposes two simple curvature-aware message-passing variants: a curvature-based edge gating mechanism and a method that uses local curvature statistics as node features.",
        "Empirical results (Table 3) show that naive curvature injection sometimes improves performance but does not consistently provide clear advantages across all models and datasets.",
        "A key insight is that while curvature exposes structural bottlenecks, solvers must learn to effectively use geometric information; the redundancy of curvature statistics in regular SAT problems is a weakness.",
        "Visualizations indicate that curvature-aware methods can lead to more linearly separable learned representations, suggesting promise for future solver design.",
