        "The accuracy of GNN-based SAT solvers is directly related to the input data structure, specifically its geometric properties (curvature).",
        "Reducing the curvature of SAT problem graphs through test-time rewiring facilitates long-range communication and significantly improves solver accuracy, especially on harder problems.",
        "The paper provides curvature-based heuristics (ω and ω*) that strongly correlate with generalization error, offering a better predictor of dataset hardness than average clause density.",
        "The relationship between input data geometry and model performance is conjectured to be prevalent throughout Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO), suggesting different architectural designs are needed for different problems.",
        "Future work should explore continuous graph diffusion dynamics for learning, characterize curvature distributions (not just means), and connect curvature to SAT's phase transitions."
