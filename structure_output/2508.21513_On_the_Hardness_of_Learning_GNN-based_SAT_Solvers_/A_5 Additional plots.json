  "key_points": [
    "Visualization of hard random 3-SAT problems reveals many long-range interactions and strongly negative average Balanced Forman Curvature (BFC), aligning with theoretical predictions.",
    "Average BFC decreases monotonically with clause density α for both 3-SAT and 4-SAT, and this drop correlates with the solvability performance of the NeuroSAT model.",
    "For 4-SAT, curvature is more negative and concentrated, leading to oversquashing and a faster performance drop-off in GNN-based solvers, occurring before the SAT-UNSAT critical threshold.",
    "The plots highlight an additional hardness phase for GNN-based solvers related to representation learning limitations, beyond traditional SAT-UNSAT thresholds."
