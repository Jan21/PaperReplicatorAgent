        "Two new heuristics, ω(G) and ω*(G), are defined based on the average and variance of graph Ricci curvature to quantify dataset hardness for GNN-based solvers.",
        "The heuristics aim to capture aspects of message-passing bottlenecks (oversquashing) that raw clause density (α) misses, relating dataset structure to GNN generalization.",
        "A correlation analysis shows these curvature-based heuristics are far better predictors of NeuroSAT's generalization error (1 - testing accuracy) than average clause density.",
        "The performance gains from the previously discussed test-time rewiring procedure (Section 3.1) are formally motivated by these results.",
        "Analysis of the CA dataset reveals that while it has high clause density, its lower average curvature (due to community structure with fewer bottlenecks) makes it easier for GNNs, explaining prior performance observations."
