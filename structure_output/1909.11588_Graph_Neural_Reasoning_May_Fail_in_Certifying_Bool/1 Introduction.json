        "Logical reasoning spans from NP-complete to undecidable problems, and understanding ML's limits on them helps define learnability boundaries and robust AI.",
        "SAT problems are structural in nature with logical connections between variables, making GNNs suitable due to their message-passing transparency.",
        "Previous successes with GNNs on SAT problems exist, but it's unclear if GNN embeddings contain enough information for complex logical reasoning like certifying UNSAT.",
        "The paper presents a pessimistic conjecture: GNNs cannot simulate complete solvers for UNSAT certification.",
        "GNNs can simulate local search heuristics like WalkSAT but fail to simulate complete solvers like DPLL and CDCL that adaptively alter Boolean formulas."
