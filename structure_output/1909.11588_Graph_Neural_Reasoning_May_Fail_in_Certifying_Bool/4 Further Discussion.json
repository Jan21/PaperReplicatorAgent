        "The analysis does not consider shrinkage conditions or dynamic GNNs (like those cited as [9]), as proving impossibility for all dynamic updating methods is difficult.",
        "The paper does not claim GNNs are provably unable to achieve UNSAT certification; this remains an open issue.",
        "Belief Propagation (BP) can find witnesses of unsatisfiability for 2QBF using a bias estimation strategy, but it has high overhead similar to RL approaches.",
        "BP's ability to find witnesses contrasts with the limitation of one-shot GNN-based embeddings, which cannot achieve this.",
        "The revealed GNN limitation is likely rooted in the simplicity of the message-passing scheme, which is good for embedding features but not for complex reasoning on graph structures."
