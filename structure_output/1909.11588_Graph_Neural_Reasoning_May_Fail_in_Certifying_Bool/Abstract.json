  "section_purpose": "This abstract introduces the paper's core research question, which is investigating the limitations of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in certifying the unsatisfiability (UNSAT) of Boolean formulae, suggesting a potential failure in learning broader logical reasoning tasks.",
  "key_points": [
    "Bridging GNNs and logical reasoning is feasible and valuable.",
    "While GNN-based solvers have seen success for Boolean SAT, their performance on more complex predicate logic formulae is unclear.",
    "The paper conjectures, with evidence, that generally-defined GNNs have limitations in certifying UNSAT for Boolean formulae.",
    "This implies GNNs may fail at learning logical reasoning tasks that include proving UNSAT as a sub-problem, which is common in predicate logic."
