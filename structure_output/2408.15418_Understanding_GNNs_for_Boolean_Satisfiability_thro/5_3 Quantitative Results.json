        "The proposed curriculum training accelerates convergence, reaching target validation accuracy (85%) in ~30 minutes compared to hours for baselines (NeuroSAT and model without curriculum).",
        "Sampling (multiple initializations of literal embeddings) and decimation (fixing variables and simplifying formulas) together significantly increase the number of solved SAT problems across various problem types.",
        "For structured problems (Latin Squares, Logical Circuits, Sudoku), using 32 samples without decimation achieves high performance, but adding a second decimation pass with fewer samples yields further improvements.",
        "Decimation involves two passes: if the first pass fails, variables with embedding distances below a threshold are fixed, the formula is simplified, and the GNN processes it again.",
        "The method is evaluated on random 40-variable problems (SR(40)) and four structured problem types, showing substantial gains over single-sample, non-decimation baselines."
