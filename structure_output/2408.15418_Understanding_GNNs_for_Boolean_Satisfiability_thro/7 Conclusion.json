  "section_purpose": "To summarize the main contributions and findings of the paper, highlighting the connection between GNNs and approximation algorithms, and to suggest future research directions.",
  "key_points": [
    "Uncovered a connection between GNNs trained on combinatorial problems and two approximation algorithms (SDP and BP).",
    "Introduced a curriculum training procedure that enables significantly faster experimentation.",
    "Applied decimation and initial-value sampling to increase the number of solved problems, requiring both correct satisfiability prediction and a satisfying assignment for satisfiable instances.",
    "The enhancements, though presented for Boolean Satisfiability, are believed to be generalizable to other domains where these approximation algorithms are used.",
    "Future work includes exploring the similarities more closely and reverse-engineering the algorithm learned by the GNN."
