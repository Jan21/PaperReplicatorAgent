        "GNNs are a flexible tool for learning representations of graph-structured data, useful for encoding complex relations and sparsity structures in combinatorial optimization problems like SAT.",
        "GNNs in combinatorial optimization typically enhance manual solvers by replacing decision heuristics or operate in end-to-end modes trained to produce final answers, with end-to-end approaches being particularly interesting for potential efficiency gains.",
        "There is a trade-off between performance on restricted input subsets and generalization to the whole domain; extreme cases may lead to GNNs learning only superficial features.",
        "This work focuses on end-to-end approaches and demonstrates improvements using the NeuroSAT architecture, which exhibits nontrivial behavior resembling continuous space search.",
        "NeuroSAT operates on an undirected bipartite graph of literals and clauses, uses alternating message-passing steps with independent LSTMs for updating embeddings, and employs MLPs for message generation and final prediction."
