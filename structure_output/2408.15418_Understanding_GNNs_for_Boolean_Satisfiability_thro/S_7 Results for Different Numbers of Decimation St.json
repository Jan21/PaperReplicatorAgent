        "Repeating the decimation process more than twice did not yield further improvement on the test sets.",
        "The first pass of decimation solves the majority of problems, with diminishing returns in subsequent passes.",
        "The hyperparameters (16 random initialization samples per formula in first pass, 1 in subsequent passes) and decimation threshold were not optimized, suggesting potential for improvement.",
        "Different problem types (SR(40), Latin Squares, Logical Circuits, Sudoku) show varying patterns of improvement across decimation passes.",
        "The results are presented quantitatively in Table 2, showing the number and percentage of SAT problems solved after each decimation pass."
