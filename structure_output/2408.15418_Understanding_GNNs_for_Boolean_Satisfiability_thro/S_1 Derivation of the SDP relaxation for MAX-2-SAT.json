        "The derivation introduces an auxiliary variable y₀ to resolve sign ambiguity when mapping Boolean variables xᵢ to relaxed variables yᵢ ∈ {-1,1}, with truth assignment determined by comparing yᵢ to y₀: xᵢ is True iff yᵢ = y₀.",
        "Clause satisfaction values v(c) are expressed as quadratic functions of the y variables, leading to an integer quadratic program objective function ∑ v(c).",
        "The integer program is reformulated using symmetric coefficient matrix W and variable matrix Y where Yᵢⱼ = yᵢ·yⱼ, with objective function Tr(WY).",
        "Relaxation occurs in two steps: first allowing yᵢ to be real values in [-1,1], then further relaxing to unit vectors in high-dimensional space (SDP relaxation).",
        "The final SDP relaxation with vector variables and rounding via random hyperplanes is shown to closely resemble the behavior of Graph Neural Networks."
