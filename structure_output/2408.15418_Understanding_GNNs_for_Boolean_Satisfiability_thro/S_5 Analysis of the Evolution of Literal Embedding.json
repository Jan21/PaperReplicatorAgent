        "The experiment tests if NeuroSAT's message-passing iterations implicitly optimize the SDP objective function for MAX-2-SAT by computing the objective from embeddings at each iteration.",
        "Results show NeuroSAT embeddings increase the SDP objective value over iterations, indicating alignment with SDP optimization, but a gap remains compared to a dedicated SDP solver.",
        "The gap is hypothesized to be partially caused by suboptimal estimation of the vector y0 (representing TRUE), as NeuroSAT does not explicitly represent it.",
        "Post-processing the final NeuroSAT-derived matrix Y with a gradient-based SDP solver closes the gap for most instances, supporting the hypothesis about y0.",
        "Analysis of matrix changes during optimization shows largest changes occur in entries involving y0, confirming its estimation is a key limitation."
