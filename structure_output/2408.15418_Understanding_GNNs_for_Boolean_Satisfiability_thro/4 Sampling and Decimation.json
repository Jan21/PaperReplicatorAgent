  "key_points": [
    "The observation that literal embeddings form two well-separated clusters for satisfiable formulas is robust, confirmed by achieving the same classification accuracy (85%) using Silhouette score on K-means clusters.",
    "Multiple random initializations of embeddings produce diverse solutions for many satisfiable problems, enabling improved classification accuracy via majority voting.",
    "Average vectors representing 'true' and 'false' values can be computed from aggregated literal embeddings, with literals' distances to these vectors serving as indicators of their truth assignments.",
    "These distances can be interpreted as marginal probabilities, motivating a decimation algorithm that fixes variables based on embedding distances, simplifies the formula, and re-runs the message-passing process."
