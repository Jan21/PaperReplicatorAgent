        "The training loop employs a curriculum learning strategy (from Section 3) where formula size increases based on validation accuracy thresholds, starting from size 5 and incrementing by 2.",
        "The training dataset size is reduced to 10,000 formulas (vs. 100,000 in original NeuroSAT) with variables sampled from [5, 40], while the test set SR(40) remains for evaluation on 40-variable problems.",
        "Key changes to the training hyperparameters include setting the learning rate to 2e-3, while most other parameters follow the original NeuroSAT implementation."
