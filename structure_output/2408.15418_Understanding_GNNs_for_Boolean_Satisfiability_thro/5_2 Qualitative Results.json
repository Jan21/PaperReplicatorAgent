        "The evolution of NeuroSAT's literal embeddings during message-passing iterations appears to optimize the SDP objective function, as shown by tracking the objective value computed from the embeddings over time.",
        "An experiment demonstrates that training NeuroSAT directly with a loss function derived from the MAX-SAT SDP objective (aiming to maximize satisfied clauses) yields a model that learns quickly without a curriculum, though its final accuracy (~73%) is lower than classification-trained NeuroSAT (~85%).",
        "The SDP objective function is transformed into a differentiable form suitable for GNN training by lifting Boolean variables to unit vectors in a high-dimensional space and computing scalar products.",
