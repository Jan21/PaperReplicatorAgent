  "key_points": [
    "Describes SAT-sweeping and its key components (equivalence class manager, SAT-sweeping manager, simulator, SAT solver) and process.",
    "Introduces using DeepGate2 embeddings to guide equivalence class selection by sorting based on cosine similarity, prioritizing gates with high functional similarity for SAT solver calls.",
    "Experiments integrate DeepGate2 into ABC's SAT sweeper '&frag', with performance evaluated on 6 industrial circuits, ensuring functional correctness via '&ecc' command.",
    "Results show significant reductions: average 53.37% decrease in SAT calls and 49.46% reduction in runtime compared to the baseline.",
    "The approach reduces invalid SAT calls and improves efficiency by refining candidate equivalence classes more effectively with counterexamples from non-equivalent gates."
