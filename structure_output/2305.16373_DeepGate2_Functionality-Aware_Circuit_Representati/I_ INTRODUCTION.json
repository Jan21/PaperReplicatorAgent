        "Circuit representation learning is a promising two-step (pre-training then fine-tuning) paradigm for EDA tasks.",
        "DeepGate embeds circuit logic and structure using signal probability supervision but has significant limitations: its supervision (logic-1 probability) does not capture the complete truth table, and its homogeneous PI embeddings fail to identify individual PIs.",
        "DeepGate2 introduces a 'functionality-aware' loss function based on the pairwise truth table difference (Hamming distance) between gates, providing genuine functional supervision.",
        "DeepGate2 employs a single-round GNN architecture with separate functional and structural embeddings for PIs, using orthogonal vectors for structural PI embeddings to encode unique identities, improving efficiency.",
        "Experiments indicate DeepGate2 achieves significant accuracy improvements and an order-of-magnitude speedup over DeepGate, with demonstrated efficacy in downstream tasks like logic synthesis and SAT solving."
