        "DeepGate is the first framework to embed both structural and functional information of digital circuits using GNNs on And-Inverter Graph (AIG) format.",
        "It uses logic-1 probability as supervision to learn functionality, approximated via random simulation of truth tables.",
        "DeepGate's GNN uses an attention-based aggregation that assigns high weights to controlling fan-ins to mimic logic computation.",
        "Limitation 1: Logic probability supervision is insufficient as it only captures statistical information, not which PI assignments lead to specific outputs, failing to differentiate circuits with same probability.",
        "Limitation 2: The model is inefficient for large circuits, requiring 20 rounds of forward/backward message passing due to identical initial PI embeddings, needing multiple rounds to distinguish nodes based on connections."
