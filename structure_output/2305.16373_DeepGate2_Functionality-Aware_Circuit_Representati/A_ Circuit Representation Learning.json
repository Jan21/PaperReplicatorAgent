        "Circuit representation learning is an attractive research direction falling into two main categories: structure-aware and functionality-aware.",
        "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a natural backbone for circuit representation as circuits can be formulated as graphs.",
        "Structure-aware models (e.g., TAG, ABGNN) focus on encoding circuit structure for physical design or block identification tasks but are not suitable for functionality-related tasks.",
        "Functionality-aware models (e.g., FGNN, DeepGate) aim to learn underlying circuit functionality, with FGNN using contrastive learning and DeepGate using logic-1 probability under random simulation as supervision.",
        "Current functionality-aware approaches have limitations: FGNN's generalization relies on data augmentation quality, and DeepGate has limitations affecting its generalizability to other EDA tasks."
