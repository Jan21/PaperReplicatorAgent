        "The multi-stage training strategy (w/ multi-stage) significantly outperforms the single-stage strategy (w/o multi-stage), achieving an average F1-Score of 0.9434 compared to 0.7137.",
        "The multi-stage strategy first trains the model to predict logic probability and structural correlation, then learns the more difficult functionality prediction task in a second stage.",
        "Learning gate functionality directly is computationally expensive (cost proportional to the square of circuit size), so the multi-stage approach uses a simplified dataset (pairs with similar logic probability) to train the functionality-aware component more effectively.",
        "Both models perform similarly on the logic probability prediction (L_prob) and reconvergence structure identification (L_rc) tasks, but the multi-stage model is much better at learning functionality, with a 51.47% lower L_func loss.",
        "The staged approach is crucial because it provides effective supervision for learning functional similarity, which fails in the single-stage model due to the complexity and cost of the task."
