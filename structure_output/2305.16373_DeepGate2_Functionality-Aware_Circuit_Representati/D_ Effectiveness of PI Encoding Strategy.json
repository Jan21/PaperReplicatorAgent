  "key_points": [
    "Disabling the PIE strategy causes a significant drop (20.07% reduction) in the F1-Score for identifying logic equivalence gates, from 0.9434 to 0.7541.",
    "The model without PIE fails to accurately model circuit structural information, particularly reconvergence structures.",
    "The model with PIE achieves 93.22% accuracy on reconvergence structure identification, whereas the model without PIE only achieves 74.56% accuracy.",
    "Accurate node functionality modeling depends on both the functionality of fan-in gates and the correct identification of reconvergence structures between them."
