  "section_purpose": "This is the title and abstract section of the paper, which provides a high-level summary of the work, its motivation, core contributions, and key results.",
  "key_points": [
    "Circuit representation learning is a promising field for EDA and logic reasoning tasks, but existing solutions like DeepGate have limitations due to weak supervision or flawed design.",
    "DeepGate2 is introduced as a novel functionality-aware learning framework that improves upon DeepGate in both effectiveness and efficiency.",
    "The approach uses pairwise truth table differences between sampled logic gates as training supervision with a designed loss function that explicitly considers circuit functionality.",
    "An efficient one-round Graph Neural Network (GNN) model is designed, resulting in an order of magnitude faster learning speed than DeepGate.",
    "Experimental results show significant improvements in downstream tasks: logic synthesis and Boolean satisfiability solving."
