  "key_points": [
    "DeepGate2 is a novel functionality-aware framework for circuit representation learning that uses pairwise truth table differences of logic gates as a supervisory signal.",
    "The framework employs two dedicated flows to concurrently update structural and functional embeddings in a single round of GNN forward message-passing.",
    "DeepGate2 shows enhanced performance over its predecessor in logic probability prediction and logic equivalent gate identification.",
    "The model achieves a tenfold improvement in efficiency.",
    "Applications on multiple downstream tasks demonstrate the framework's effectiveness and potential in the EDA field."
