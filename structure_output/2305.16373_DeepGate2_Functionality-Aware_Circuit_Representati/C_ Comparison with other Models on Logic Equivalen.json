        "DeepGate2 significantly outperforms both DeepGate and FGNN, achieving a superior average F1-score of 0.9434.",
        "DeepGate achieves high recall (91.46%) but low precision (54.00%), leading to many false positives because it relies solely on logic probability similarity.",
        "FGNN performs the worst (F1-score 0.4402) due to limitations of its contrastive, structure-focused self-supervised training, which fails when functionally equivalent circuits have different topologies.",
        "A specific analysis on circuit D7 highlights DeepGate2's high precision (97.48%) and accuracy (99.15%), demonstrating a low false positive rate."
