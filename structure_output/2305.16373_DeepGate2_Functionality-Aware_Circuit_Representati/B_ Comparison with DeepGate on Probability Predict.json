  "section_purpose": "This section presents a comparative evaluation between the proposed DeepGate2 model and its predecessor, DeepGate, focusing on the key metrics of prediction accuracy and runtime efficiency.",
  "key_points": [
    "DeepGate2 achieves a 13.08% lower probability prediction error (PE) on average compared to the original DeepGate.",
    "DeepGate2 is significantly more efficient than DeepGate, with an average runtime speedup of 16.43x.",
    "The performance improvements are attributed to the novel model architecture, embedding initialization strategy, and the use of a one-round GNN that performs only one forward propagation.",
    "The new model demonstrates improved generalization ability on large-scale circuits."
