  "section_purpose": "To define the problem of insufficient functional representation in existing circuit learning models and propose an improved model that captures functional similarity in embeddings.",
  "key_points": [
    "The model aims to map circuit structure and functionality into embedding space, where structure refers to gate connections and functionality refers to logic mappings from inputs to outputs.",
    "Previous models like DeepGate lack the ability to capture functional information, making it hard to identify logic equivalent circuits based on embeddings.",
    "An example with Circuits A, B, C, and D illustrates that embeddings should reflect functional similarity based on truth tables, not just structural similarity.",
    "The goal is to develop a model that brings together or separates circuits in embedding space according to their truth tables, enabling identification of logic equivalence and functional similarity.",
    "This functionality-aware approach is expected to benefit real-world applications such as logic synthesis and Boolean satisfiability solving."
