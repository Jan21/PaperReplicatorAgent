    "key_points": [
        "ANYCSP_qual performs significantly worse on graph coloring than ANYCSP_loc and ANYCSP, only outperforming the baseline RUNCSP and a simple greedy approach.",
        "For MAXCUT and MAX-k-SAT, both ablated versions (ANYCSP_loc and ANYCSP_qual) perform significantly worse than the full ANYCSP model, with no clear performance hierarchy between them.",
        "Analysis on MAX-k-SAT shows ANYCSP_loc converges slowly and steadily, while ANYCSP_qual converges fast initially but tapers off early due to getting stuck in local maxima.",
        "The study concludes that both a global search space (for parallel refinement and search speed) and a well-chosen exploration-encouraging reward scheme are crucial for strong performance.",
        "The combination of global search and the sophisticated reward scheme in ANYCSP yields the best results across different CSPs, validating the method's core design choices."
