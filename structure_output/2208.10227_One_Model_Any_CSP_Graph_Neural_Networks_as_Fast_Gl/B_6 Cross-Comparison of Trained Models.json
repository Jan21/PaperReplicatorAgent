    "Each ANYCSP model performs best on the CSP distribution it was trained on.",
    "There is significant compatibility between MODEL RB and graph coloring, with models trained on one solving instances of the other effectively.",
    "The choice of aggregation function (MAX, MEAN, SUM) is crucial for generalization and performance across different CSPs.",
    "The MAXCUT model is highly specialized and does not generalize to other problems, while no other models perform competitively on MAXCUT.",
    "Generalization success depends on the similarity of instance distributions and the robustness of the aggregation functions used."
