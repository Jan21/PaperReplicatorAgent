        "MAXCUT is modeled as a CSP instance using the same reduction as vertex coloring but with a fixed number of colors (k=2), applicable to graphs with positive edge weights.",
        "The training data distribution consists of Erdős-Rényi graphs with 100 vertices and edge probabilities sampled uniformly from [0.05, 0.3]; validation uses the same edge probability distribution but with 500 vertices.",
        "Classical baselines include a constructive greedy algorithm and an SDP-based approximation algorithm (Goemans and Williamson 1995), with a 3-hour timeout limiting SDP to graphs under 1000 vertices.",
        "Neural baselines are RUNCSP (trained on the same distribution), ECORD, and ECO-DQN (trained on distributions from Barrett et al.'s Gset experiments).",
        "The experimental setup selects a single model for each neural method using Erdős-Rényi graphs for validation, aiming to test generalization to unseen sizes and structures, unlike the per-test-group model selection used in some prior work."
