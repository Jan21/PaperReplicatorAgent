    "key_points": [
        "Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) are a ubiquitous, flexible framework for NP-hard combinatorial problems (e.g., SAT, graph coloring, MAXCUT), but solution strategies range from general to highly specialized solvers.",
        "There is growing interest in using deep learning, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), to learn heuristics for combinatorial problems, but most existing GNN approaches are problem-specific and hard to transfer across tasks.",
        "The paper proposes ANYCSP, a novel GNN-based reinforcement learning approach for general CSPs, featuring a new generic graph representation for CSP instances usable by a single unified architecture.",
        "ANYCSP performs a global search (allowing transitions between any two assignments in a step) using policy gradient methods to handle exponential action spaces, overcoming the scalability bottleneck of previous neural local-search methods that flip few variables per step.",
        "The method is trained unsupervised with a tailored reward scheme to encourage exploration and avoid local maxima, and it generalizes to CSP instances with unseen domain sizes, constraint arities, or relations."
