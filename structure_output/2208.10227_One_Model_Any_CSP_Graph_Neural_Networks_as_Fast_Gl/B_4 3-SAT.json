    "Modeling a Boolean CNF formula as a CSP instance with Boolean variables (domain {0,1}) and constraints derived from clauses, where each constraint excludes the single unsatisfying assignment.",
    "Training data consists of random uniform 3SAT instances with 100 variables and a clause/variable ratio between 4 and 5, near the satisfiability threshold; validation uses 200 variables with the same density.",
    "Baseline methods include PDP (trained on the same distribution), RLSAT (trained with a curriculum learning sequence), WalkSAT (with tuned parameters but defaults used), and probSAT (default configuration).",
    "Experimental setup involves running each method for 10,000 steps per instance, with 10 runs for non-deterministic methods and taking the best attempt as the output."
