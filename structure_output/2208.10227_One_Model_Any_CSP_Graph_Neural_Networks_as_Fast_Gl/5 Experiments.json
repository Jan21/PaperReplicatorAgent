  "section_purpose": "This section evaluates the performance of the ANYCSP model on a wide range of constraint satisfaction problems, comparing it against classical solvers, heuristics, and previous neural approaches across multiple benchmark datasets.",
  "key_points": [
    "ANYCSP is evaluated on six CSP types: MODEL RB, Graph Coloring, MAXCUT, 3-SAT, MAX-k-SAT, demonstrating broad applicability.",
    "ANYCSP outperforms or matches state-of-the-art baselines across all problems, often by substantial margins, despite being trained on smaller instances.",
    "The model shows strong generalization to instances significantly larger (100x) and more complex than those seen during training.",
    "ANYCSP's global search approach (changing multiple variables per step) is crucial; a local search variant performs worse, highlighting the importance of parallel refinement.",
    "ANYCSP achieves superior results while performing orders of magnitude fewer search steps than classical heuristics, though each step is computationally more expensive."
