    "key_points": [
        "Proposes a universal GNN architecture trainable as an end-to-end search heuristic for any CSP.",
        "The method uses unsupervised training via policy gradient descent and a novel generic graph representation for CSPs.",
        "Operates on a global search action space, allowing modification of any number of variables per step, leveraging GNN parallelism.",
        "Empirical evaluation shows the approach outperforms prior neural methods and can compete with or improve upon conventional heuristics.",
        "Tested on important CSPs including graph coloring, MAXCUT, 3-SAT, and MAX-k-SAT, generalizing to larger and more complex instances than seen in training."
