  "section_purpose": "This section formalizes the application of the REINFORCE reinforcement learning algorithm to train the ANYCSP model, explaining how policy gradients are computed and optimized despite the extremely large action space.",
  "key_points": [
    "The large action space (all possible assignments) is handled efficiently by modeling probability distributions as soft assignments, where each variable's value is sampled independently.",
    "The training objective is to maximize the discounted cumulative reward over the search trajectory, using a discount factor λ to encourage quick reward acquisition.",
    "The REINFORCE algorithm is applied directly without a baseline or critic network, which surprisingly works effectively despite the large action space.",
    "Policy gradients are estimated using the sampled hard assignments and their probabilities under the soft assignments, with a small ε added for numerical stability.",
    "Training involves sampling batches of instances, running ANYCSP for T steps per instance to generate sequences, computing gradients, and updating parameters via Adam optimizer."
