        "Neural networks have been used in EDA for data processing, process optimization, and accelerating verification tasks like logic equivalence checking (LEC).",

        "End-to-end GNN-based SAT solving faces challenges with reliability and performance, especially in industrial contexts, due to SAT problem complexity.",
        "GNN-based heuristic guidance methods are more practical, as they accelerate solvers while maintaining reliability by letting the solver handle the core solving process.",
        "The proposed IB-Net model fits into the heuristic guidance category, aiming to enhance SAT solver robustness and efficiency for industrial scenarios through GNN-solver interaction."
