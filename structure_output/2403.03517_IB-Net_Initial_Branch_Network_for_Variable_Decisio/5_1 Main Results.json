        "IB-Net significantly outperforms baseline models, specifically the SATGNN baseline, in the UNSAT-core prediction task by a large margin (19.53% absolute improvement in Average Precision).",
        "For runtime reduction performance, IB-Net-trained solvers substantially reduce the number of conflicts and achieve faster solving times compared to the native Glucose 3.0 solver, indicating its capability to guide the decision heuristic effectively.",
        "The results confirm the central hypothesis that a neural model can learn to predict good branching decisions by identifying variables likely to be part of an unsatisfiable core, thereby improving solver efficiency.",
        "The superior performance is attributed to the specific architecture and loss functions of IB-Net, as discussed in the ablation study, rather than the general graph-based approach.",
        "IB-Net's training strategy, which integrates supervision from UNSAT core variables as well as conflict analysis during solving (e.g., 1st-UIP clauses), is validated as effective."
