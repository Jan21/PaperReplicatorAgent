    "IB-Net outperforms other methodologies on the UNSAT-core prediction task across both the LEC and SAT Competition datasets.",
    "IB-Net demonstrates strong F1 scores on the LEC dataset, indicating accurate identification of variables both inside and outside the UNSAT-core.",
    "Other approaches perform reasonably on the SAT Competition dataset but significantly lag behind IB-Net on the LEC dataset, suggesting they struggle with the imbalance nature of the LEC dataset.",
    "The UNSAT-core variable distribution differs greatly between datasets: over 90% of variables are in the UNSAT-core for LEC problems, while only around 40% are in the UNSAT-core for SAT Competition UNSAT problems.",
    "IB-Net is shown to be an efficient and potent model for UNSAT-core prediction, effective on both balanced and imbalanced datasets."
