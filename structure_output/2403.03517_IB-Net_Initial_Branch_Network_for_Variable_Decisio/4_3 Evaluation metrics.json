        "Two main aspects are evaluated: the efficacy of UNSAT-core prediction for unsatisfiable problems, and the end-to-end time efficiency of models when used with the Kissat solver compared to Kissat alone.",
        "A.RT (Average Runtime) is used to measure the average runtime across all CNF instances.",
        "Imp. (Efficiency Improvement) quantifies the reduction in runtime (in seconds) compared to the original Kissat solver.",
        "Halted counts the number of CNF instances that timed out within the 1000-second limit.",
        "All reported runtimes for neural-network-based solutions include the time for graph construction and inference."
