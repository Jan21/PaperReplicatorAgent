    "key_points": [
        "CDCL algorithm consists of four main stages: decision-making, unit propagation, conflict analysis, and non-chronological backtracking/backjumping.",
        "Conflicts trigger clause learning (adding new clauses) to prevent repeated errors, and backtracking jumps to points before the conflict rather than just reverting the last decision.",
        "Two critical stages are conflict analysis (clause learning) and variable decision, which collaboratively construct the decision queue for variable branching.",
        "Swift identification of variables within the UNSAT-core accelerates solving UNSAT problems, while prematurely including variables outside the UNSAT-core slows down the solver.",
        "The section argues for guiding the decision queue and decision score (internal variable used in variable decision and conflict analysis) to optimize solver performance."
