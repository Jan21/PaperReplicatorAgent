  "key_points": [
    "Boolean Satisfiability problems are vital in Electronic Design Automation, particularly for Logic Equivalence Checking.",
    "Existing neural network assistance fails in this domain due to the predominantly unsatisfiable nature and high proportion of UNSAT-core variables in SAT problems for LEC.",
    "Proposal of IB-Net, an innovative framework using graph neural networks and novel graph encoding techniques to model unsatisfiable problems and interact with solvers.",
    "IB-Net achieves average runtime speedups of 5.0% on industrial data and 8.3% on SAT competition data, accelerating solver performance.",
    "This breakthrough advances efficient solving in LEC workflows."
