    "Two datasets are utilized: industrial LEC circuit SAT instances from chip design and the SAT Competition 2022 anniversary track.",
    "Datasets are filtered to include only instances solvable by Kissat within 1,000 seconds to manage complexity and reflect real-life constraints.",
    "Dataset statistics are provided in Table 1, showing the number of CNFs, average variables, and average clauses for each dataset and sub-category.",
    "Supervision for training is obtained by using Kissat to find variable assignments for SAT instances and Drat-trim to extract UNSAT-cores for UNSAT instances.",
    "The LEC dataset is predominantly UNSAT (over 99%), while the SAT Competition dataset includes SAT, UNSAT, and halted instances."
