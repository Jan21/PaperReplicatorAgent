    "key_points": [
        "IB-Net achieves the shortest average runtime and shows improvement over Kissat on both LEC Circuit and SAT Competition datasets.",
        "IB-Net improves average runtime by 19 seconds (5%) on LEC Circuit and 15 seconds (8.3%) on SAT Competition compared to Kissat.",
        "Other methods (NeuroCore, NeuroSAT, NLocalSAT) exhibit much longer average runtimes compared to Kissat and face additional halted instances, while IB-Net reduces halted instances.",
        "On three main circuit subsets of the LEC dataset, IB-Net consistently outperforms all other methods, validating its universal effectiveness for UNSAT problems.",
        "There is consistency between UNSAT-core prediction quality and runtime efficiency improvement, suggesting that eliminating non-core variables from decision queues improves performance."
