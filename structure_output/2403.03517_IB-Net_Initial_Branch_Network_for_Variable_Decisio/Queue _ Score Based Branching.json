  "section_purpose": "To describe the novel methodology for integrating neural network predictions into the CDCL solver's branching process, using predicted probabilities to initialize decision scores and queues.",
  "key_points": [
    "The trained network infers probabilities for each variable being in the UNSAT-core before solving.",
    "These probabilities initialize the solver's decision scores and are used to rank variables into a descending queue for branching decisions.",
    "This approach allows the solver to prioritize variables highly related to unsatisfiability early.",
    "The inference is performed only once per problem, adding minimal computational overhead (<1.5 seconds including preprocessing).",
    "The method maintains solver completeness while enhancing efficiency and speed, and runs efficiently on CPUs."
