  "key_points": [
    "IB-Net is a novel GNN-based approach tailored for UNSAT problem solving in the Logic Equivalence Checking (LEC) process.",
    "It predicts a decision strategy queue and decision scores to assist CDCL SAT solvers, significantly accelerating SAT solving and outperforming existing methods.",
    "The method can solve instances previously unsolvable by traditional SAT solvers, especially within the LEC context.",
    "The approach demonstrates the impactful blend of machine learning with traditional SAT solving for more efficient and robust solvers."
