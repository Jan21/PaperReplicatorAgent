        "Experiments compare three solvers: the original solver from a cited paper, and two GNN-enhanced solvers that use fast vs. accurate joint information entropy calculations, both trained with a specific new loss function.",
        "Results are presented in Table 1 as approximation ratios (mean ± standard deviation) across real-world datasets (Twitter, COLLAB, IMDB) and synthetic G(n,p) instances of varying densities.",
        "The GNN-enhanced solvers, particularly those using a slower, more accurate entropy calculation, show strong performance, often achieving near-perfect or high approximation ratios.",
        "Figure 1 analysis suggests GNN-enhanced solvers perform better on instances where no dominating clique exists, as the learned heuristic can prune the entire search space more effectively.",
        "On instances where dominating cliques do exist, the original heuristic might be equally effective because solvers can terminate early upon finding a solution."
