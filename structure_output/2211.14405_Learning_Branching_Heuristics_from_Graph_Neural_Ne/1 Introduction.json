    "key_points": [
        "Machine learning (especially deep learning) has been applied to CSPs and COPs, e.g., in portfolio SAT solvers (SATzilla) and using CNNs/GNNs for prediction or learning greedy heuristics.",
        "This work uses GNNs to learn branching heuristics for exact backtracking search methods, differing from prior ML approaches that focus on portfolio selection, direct solution sampling, or approximation algorithms.",
        "The approach is inspired by prior work introducing the probabilistic method into GNNs; node features from GNNs are interpreted as probability distributions, and information entropy guides the branching heuristic.",
        "The paper focuses on the dominating-clique problem because: (1) prior empirical studies show hard instances resist human-designed heuristics (small variance vs. average branch count), and (2) it involves non-trivial global conditions beyond local properties (unlike, e.g., maximum clique)."
