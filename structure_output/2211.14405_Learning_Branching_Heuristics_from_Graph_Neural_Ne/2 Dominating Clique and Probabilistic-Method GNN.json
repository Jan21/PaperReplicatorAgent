        "A Dominating Clique (DC) is a clique subset S of vertices such that S dominates all vertices not in S (each vertex outside S has a neighbor in S).",
        "The paper's GNN is trained unsupervised to learn a Bernoulli probability distribution for each vertex, and these distributions are used to design branching heuristics rather than to sample solutions directly.",
        "The loss function approximates the probability measure of dominating cliques in the graph using the correlation inequality from the probabilistic method, aiming to maximize this approximation.",
        "The approach differs from prior work (Li et al.) in being designed for an exact backtracking solver (counting branches) rather than a heuristic tree search algorithm (solved problems fraction).",
        "The learned probability distributions produce vertex information entropy which replaces the original heuristic in a DC solver, and experimentally prunes more search space."
