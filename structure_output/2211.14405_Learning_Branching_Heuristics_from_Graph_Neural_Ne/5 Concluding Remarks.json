        "The paper developed an approach using the probabilistic method in GNN design to learn branching heuristics for exact solvers.",
        "The approach is applicable to combinatorial problems focused on finding optimal constrained vertex subsets in graphs.",
        "Specific example applications mentioned are the maximum/minimum dominating-independent-set problem and the maximum-clique problem.",
        "Future work aims to extend the approach to problems involving optimal collections of vertex subsets, where a vertex can belong to multiple subsets.",
        "Examples of such future problems include the tree-decomposition problem and the edge-clique-cover problem.",
        "The work is positioned as an initial effort to apply GNN techniques to improve classical AI algorithms."
