  "key_points": [
    "Three GNN models were trained for finding minimum dominating cliques, differing in their loss functions (Equation (5) and two variants of Equation (6) with different expected size calculations).",
    "Six GNN-enhanced solvers were created by combining the three models with fast and accurate versions of joint information entropy.",
    "Experiments were run on training, validation, and test data generated from G(n,p) random graphs with edge probability p ∈ (0.4, 0.41) and 50 instances per graph size n.",
    "Results are shown in Tables 5, 6, and 7, comparing the original solver (O) and the GNN-based solvers (labeled (5), (6), and (7) corresponding to their loss functions)."
