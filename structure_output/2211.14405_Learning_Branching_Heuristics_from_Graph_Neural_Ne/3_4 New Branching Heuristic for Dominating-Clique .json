        "The section introduces a function f(Var_b, Θ) to measure branch quality in a search tree, using the GNN's output probability space Θ.",
        "It adapts an existing efficient backtracking solver for dominating cliques (Algorithm 1), which originally uses the MRV (Minimum Remaining Values) heuristic.",
        "The core improvement replaces the MRV heuristic (which minimizes |C'∩S|) with a new heuristic that selects the unsatisfied clause C where the joint information entropy of the variables in C∩S is minimized.",
        "Two methods are proposed to calculate the joint information entropy: a fast but approximate version, and a slower but more accurate version.",
        "The probability distributions of unassigned variables are dynamically updated during search using the softmax function (found to perform better than Z-score normalization)."

            "Accurate joint entropy calculation (Equation 8): ∑_{i=1}^m [ p * ( -log₂(p) + ∑_{v_r ∈ N(v_i) \\ {v_1,...,v_{i-1}} } H(X_r) ) ], where p = p_i ∏_{j=1}^{i-1} (1 - p_j) ∏_{v_k ∈ {v_{i+1},...,v_m} \\ N(v_i)} (1 - p_k). This accounts for dependencies from dominating clique properties."
