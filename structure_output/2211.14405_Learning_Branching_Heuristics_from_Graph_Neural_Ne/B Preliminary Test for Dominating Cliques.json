        "The test creates synthetic graph instances using the G(n,p) random graph model across a range of parameters to evaluate the loss function.",
        "The loss function values output by the trained GNN model are examined for instances with varying likelihoods of containing dominating cliques.",
        "The results show a correlation between loss function values and the known phase transition: instances with low edge probability (p=0.1) have higher loss (lower probability of a dominating clique), while instances with high edge probability (p=0.9) have lower loss (higher probability).",
        "The experimental data is visualized in Figure 3, plotting average loss against graph size (n) for different edge probabilities (p)."
