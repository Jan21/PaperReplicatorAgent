        "Three solvers are compared: the original solver (O), and two GNN-enhanced solvers using fast (F) and accurate (A) joint information entropy calculations.",
        "Performance is measured by counting the number of branches in the search tree, with results reported for training, validation, and test datasets of random graphs G(n,p).",
        "For each graph size (n), the results show how many times each solver 'wins' (produces a smaller search tree) against the others and report average branch counts.",
        "Results are reported for all instances, with numbers in brackets representing results only for instances where a dominating clique exists.",
        "Across most graph sizes and datasets, the GNN-enhanced solvers (F and A) generally outperform the original solver (O), and solver A often outperforms solver F."
