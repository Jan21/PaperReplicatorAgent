    "key_points": [
        "The prior work's loss function is based on the first-moment method, defining a random variable as f(S) + indicator(S not a solution)*β, leading to a loss L = E(f(S)) + P(S not solution)*β.",
        "Two key drawbacks of the prior approach are identified: 1) A trade-off where making the loss bound easier to satisfy (t close to 0) reduces the probability guarantee of finding a valid solution, and 2) The difficulty in choosing an appropriate β value and the need to use upper bounds for P(S not solution), which hinders convergence.",
        "A new loss function is proposed: minimizing E(f(S)) / P(S is a solution), which aims to maximize the probability measure of solutions with low f values.",
        "The practical implementation of the new loss function uses the logarithmic form: ln(E(f(S))) - ln(P(S is a solution)).",
        "The logarithmic form is intended to balance the scale difference between the expectation term E(f(S)) and the probability term P(S is a solution), ensuring they are weighted proportionally."
