    "key_points": [
        "The maximum-clique problem has only local constraints, while the dominating-clique problem has both local (clique) and global (domination) constraints, making it a more complex target for GNN-based exact algorithms.",
        "Instead of directly evaluating the closed-form probability P(D_S ∩ C_S) that a set S is a dominating clique, the method optimizes its upper and lower bounds simultaneously.",
        "The derived loss function L (Equation 5) for the dominating-clique problem is the negative sum of log probabilities related to domination events (A_i) and clique non-edges (B_ij).",
        "For the *minimum* dominating clique problem, the loss function L (Equation 6) adds a term ln(E(|S|)) to encourage smaller solutions.",
        "An improved expectation term (Equation 7) is proposed for the minimum problem, calculated over a generated event space closer to the set of dominating cliques rather than all subsets, to more accurately target small dominating cliques."
