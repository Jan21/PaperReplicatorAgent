    "section_purpose": "This section presents experimental results evaluating the proposed framework's effectiveness on three combinatorial optimization problems (Max-Cut, MIS, MDS) to answer Q1: whether Max-SAT transfer and the pre-training/adaptation pipeline improve solving performance.",
    "key_points": [
        "The proposed framework achieves best results compared to other learning-based methods, demonstrating its ability to learn useful information from CO problems.",
        "The method shows superiority, especially on large-scale Max-Cut problems (e.g., n=800, G22, G55), outperforming traditional methods that sometimes run out of memory.",
        "For MIS and MDS on frb datasets, results are competitive and closer to solver results, showing framework effectiveness.",
        "Traditional/heuristic methods remain competitive in Max-Cut, but the performance gap with the proposed method is small while training/inference time is much less.",
        "The experiments answer Q1: Max-SAT provides common knowledge, and the pre-training/adaptation pipeline learns transferable features to improve solving different CO problems."
