        "Traditional GNN message-passing schemes are insufficient for bipartite graphs because they assume a single node type, whereas bipartite graphs have two distinct types (variables and clauses).",
        "The proposed bipartite GNN uses a two-step, layer-wise message-passing process: clause-wise aggregation (from variables to clauses) followed by variable-wise aggregation (from clauses to variables).",
        "An attention mechanism is integrated into both aggregation steps to learn the importance of neighboring nodes when updating features.",
        "Initial node attributes for variables (X) and clauses (C) are set to all-one matrices after experiments showed no significant impact from other initialization strategies (uniform/normal distributions).",
        "The final output is updated feature representations for variables X^(L) and clauses C^(L), capturing their correlations and enabling building the overall framework on this Bip-GNN backbone."
