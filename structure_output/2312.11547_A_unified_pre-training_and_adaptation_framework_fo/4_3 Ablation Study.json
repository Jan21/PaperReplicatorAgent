  "key_points": [
    "All modules contribute positively to overall performance, with the complete framework achieving the best results.",
    "The problem transfer step (converting CO problems to Max-SAT and bipartite graphs) is the most critical component, showing the largest performance drop when removed.",
    "Both pre-training and domain adaptation modules improve performance, demonstrating their complementary utility.",
    "Attention mechanisms and multi-head mechanisms in the bipartite GNN also positively impact performance, indicating their importance for feature extraction."
