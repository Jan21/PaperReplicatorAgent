  "section_purpose": "To verify the knowledge transfer ability of the model by examining how different source domains (Max-SAT, Max-Cut, MDS) affect performance on the target domain MIS, and to demonstrate the impact of domain relevance on transferability.",
  "key_points": [
    "The model's transfer ability is tested with MIS as the target domain and Max-SAT, Max-Cut, and MDS as source domains, using pre-training and domain adaptation.",
    "Max-SAT → MIS consistently yields the best performance, indicating Max-SAT has the strongest and most general transferability across CO problems.",
    "MDS → MIS performs better than Max-Cut → MIS, suggesting MDS is more relevant to MIS than Max-Cut.",
    "Different source domains significantly affect target domain performance, with irrelevant tasks potentially causing negative transfers.",
    "Experiments were conducted on two node scales (450 and 760 variables), with results visualized in heat maps showing performance variations."
