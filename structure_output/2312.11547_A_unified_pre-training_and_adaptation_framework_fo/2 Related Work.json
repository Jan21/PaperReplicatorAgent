    "Categorizes learning methods for CO problems into four types: end-to-end, two-stage, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning approaches.",
    "Highlights limitations of existing learning methods, particularly their narrow applicability to specific CO problems rather than general frameworks.",
    "Describes different graph neural network architectures including GCNs, GATs, GraphSAGE, and Transformer-based models.",
    "Points out that existing GNNs are primarily designed for node-level tasks rather than the edge-focused requirements of CO problems.",
    "Establishes the paper's contribution as a unified framework bridging pre-training and adaptation for multiple CO problems."
