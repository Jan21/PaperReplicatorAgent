    "section_purpose": "This section provides a review and categorization of traditional and modern learning-based methods for solving combinatorial optimization (CO) problems, highlighting the limitations of traditional approaches and the promise of data-driven methods.",
    "key_points": [
        "Traditional CO solution methods include branch and bound (reduce search space via decomposition/pruning), dynamic programming (exploit overlapping subproblem structures), and heuristic algorithms (use strategies/randomness to search solution space).",
        "Traditional methods are limited by high computational complexity, poor scalability for large problems, and difficulty finding globally optimal solutions.",
        "Deep learning methods form two main categories: 1) approximating the CO solution process to capture patterns and guide search, offering speed and scalability benefits, and 2) learning-based heuristics/meta-heuristics that use models to create intelligent decision rules or policies.",
        "Reinforcement learning techniques have been particularly successful in learning effective exploration-exploitation strategies for CO problems.",
        "Incorporating learning-based heuristics into traditional optimization algorithms can yield higher-quality solutions with less computational effort."
