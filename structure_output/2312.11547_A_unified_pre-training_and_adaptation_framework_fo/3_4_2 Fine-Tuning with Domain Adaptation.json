  "section_purpose": "To describe the fine-tuning process that applies domain adaptation to transfer knowledge from pre-trained Max-SAT models to target combinatorial optimization problems, enabling learning of domain-invariant features.",
  "key_points": [
    "Fine-tuning uses domain adaptation to learn transferable features from Max-SAT (source domain) to CO problems (target domain).",
    "The network architecture includes pre-trained feature extraction backbones (MLP and Bip-GNN), separate classification layers for each domain, and a discriminator for domain classification.",
    "The overall loss function combines classification loss (ℒ_c) and discriminative loss (ℒ_d) with a weighting hyperparameter λ.",
    "Data for source and target domains is constructed using transformations from section 3.2, with source data from varied Max-SAT distributions and target data from CO-converted Max-SAT.",
    "The framework is designed for supervised settings but can be extended to unsupervised settings where target labels are unavailable."
