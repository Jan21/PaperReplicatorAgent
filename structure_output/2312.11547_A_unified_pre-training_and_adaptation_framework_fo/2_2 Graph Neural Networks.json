        "GNNs follow a message-passing mechanism and are a core deep-learning framework for graphs, with major variants including GCNs (spectral), GraphSAGE (inductive learning), and GATs (with self-attention).",
        "Recent trends involve adapting GNNs via prompt tuning (e.g., GPPT) to generalize pre-trained models without fine-tuning and addressing theoretical issues like over-smoothing and over-squashing (e.g., via BORF rewiring).",
        "The expressive power of GNNs is a subject of theoretical study, explaining their success across many tasks.",
        "GNNs are applied to graph domain adaptation to handle domain shifts, often using adversarial training to learn domain-invariant features (e.g., TFLG, GCAN).",
        "Domain adaptation strategies extend to aligning structural and spectral information (e.g., StruRW) and leveraging multi-level invariant information."
