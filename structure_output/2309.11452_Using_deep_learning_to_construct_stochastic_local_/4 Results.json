    "Full oracle-based algorithm outperforms uniform and hybrid variants for both MT and WalkSAT solvers across all metrics.",
    "WalkSAT dominates the MT algorithm in performance for each variant.",
    "Significant speed-ups are observed in median steps required, with factors of more than 8 for MT and around 5 for WalkSAT, indicating effectiveness on simpler instances.",
    "Access to GNN-based oracle shifts performance curves for α values (around 3.0 to 3.2), increasing the average α for solved instances by 17%.",
    "The hybrid variant loses its initial advantage quickly, highlighting the importance of continuous oracle access during solving."
