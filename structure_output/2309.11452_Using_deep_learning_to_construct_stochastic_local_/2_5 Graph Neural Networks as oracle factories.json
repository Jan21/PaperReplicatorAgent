  "key_points": [
    "GNNs are suitable ML models for oracle factories as they can return both the factory and the parametrized functional required for evaluating the LLL loss.",
    "The Interaction Network (IN) is used, which operates on graphs with node and edge features and updates them via a message passing algorithm.",
    "Update functions for nodes (η^N) and edges (η^E) are defined as neural networks composed of layer normalization, ReLU, and fully connected layers.",
    "A full IN consists of multiple consecutive IN layers followed by a final fully connected layer to ensure one-dimensional outputs across nodes and edges.",
    "The edge aggregation function ρ^E is summation over edges for each node."
