  "section_purpose": "This section introduces the motivation for integrating deep learning into SAT solving, specifically proposing the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as oracle factories to generate instance-specific distributions for stochastic local search (SLS) solvers, based on theoretical guarantees for efficient solving.",
  "key_points": [
    "Deep learning has been successfully applied to constraint optimization problems, including Boolean Satisfiability (SAT), as a prototypical NP-complete problem.",
    "Machine learning models can learn structural patterns from data distributions, enabling solvers to perform efficiently on typical instances, even if performance drops on atypical ones.",
    "The paper's approach uses a GNN as an oracle factory to produce instance-specific sampling oracles for SLS solvers, differing from methods that only use ML for initial solutions.",
    "The work is motivated by theoretical computer science results that provide sufficient conditions for SLS solvers with appropriate oracles to find solutions efficiently.",
    "Figure 1 illustrates the general idea: from basic SLS to oracle-based SLS, and finally using a learned oracle factory to map instances to oracles."
