        "The work connects machine learning methods with theoretical computer science to create application-specific solvers that have performance guarantees.",
        "Introduces a new, theoretically motivated loss function called the Lovász Local loss (LLL loss), designed to reward oracles that exploit local structure in SAT instances.",
        "Constructs and trains two oracle-based Stochastic Local Search (SLS) solvers using an Interaction Network architecture.",
        "Empirical evaluation on random 3-SAT shows ML-based solvers solve instances with ~17% higher clause-to-variable ratio (α), in ~35% fewer steps, and with an >8x improvement in median step count.",
        "Shows that continuous oracle access during search yields significantly better results than only using an oracle for initialization."
