  "section_purpose": "To survey and position existing deep learning approaches for SAT solving, specifically focusing on stochastic local search (SLS) methods and highlighting how they differ from the oracle-based approach proposed in this paper.",
  "key_points": [
    "Existing literature includes GNNs used to generate initial candidates for SLS solvers, but not as oracles during solver execution.",
    "Other work uses GNNs to learn variable selection heuristics within WalkSAT-type solvers, but these are policy-based and not oracles as defined in this paper.",
    "The cross-entropy loss with respect to a Gibbs distribution used in this paper is also employed in a different context (Mixed Integer Program solving).",
    "The key distinction is that prior work does not use learned models as oracles within SLS algorithms with performance guarantees."
