        "Stochastic Local Search (SLS) algorithms work by iteratively generating candidate assignments and updating variables in violated clauses until a solution is found or a stopping criterion is met.",

        "An oracle is introduced as a random variable over assignments that can provide instance-specific sampling distributions, enabling better performance than uniform sampling.",
        "Oracle-based versions of MT and WalkSAT algorithms are presented, which generalize their non-oracle counterparts by replacing uniform random choices with oracle-guided ones.",
        "The oracle-based WalkSAT's variable selection probability is inspired by ProbSAT and is proportional to the oracle's likelihood of sampling a state with the flipped value assignment."
