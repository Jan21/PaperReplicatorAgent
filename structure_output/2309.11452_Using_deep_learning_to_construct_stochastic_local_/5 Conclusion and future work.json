    "The main contribution is a deep learning approach to construct SLS-based SAT solvers with algorithms and loss functions theoretically guaranteed to produce stronger solvers in expectation.",
    "The approach aims to create solvers that are both highly performant for specific applications and provably robust in terms of average performance.",
    "Empirical investigation on a random 3-SAT dataset shows promising results, but the practical potential remains largely uncharted.",
    "Future work needs more thorough experiments on larger, application-oriented datasets, research on suitable deep learning architectures, and application to more mature SLS solvers.",
    "The resulting solvers are currently far from competitive with state-of-the-art solvers."
