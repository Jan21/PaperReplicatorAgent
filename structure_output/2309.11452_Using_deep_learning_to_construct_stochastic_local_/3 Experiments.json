        "Experiments focus on random 3-SAT instances where difficulty is measured by the clause-to-variable ratio α=m/n, with special interest in the 'hard' regime where traditional solvers fail.",
        "The training dataset consists of 396 satisfiable instances with n∈[100,200,300] and α ranging from 1 to 4.82, generated via CNFgen and verified satisfiable by Glucose3.",

        "Evaluation uses 2052 test instances across the same n and α ranges, with each algorithm run up to 10^6 steps over 5 runs per instance, using multiple performance metrics.",
        "Results indicate that GNN-boosted variants of MT and WalkSAT algorithms outperform uniform and hybrid baselines, extending the efficient solving regime to higher α values."
