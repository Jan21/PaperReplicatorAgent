    "key_points": [
        "Circuit Satisfiability (CSAT) is crucial for EDA tasks like Logic Equivalence Checking and ATPG, but traditional methods convert circuits to CNF and use CDCL solvers, discarding structural circuit insights.",
        "Current circuit-aware methods rely on static analysis or preprocessing and fail to provide dynamic guidance during solver execution, creating a disconnect between static structures and dynamic CDCL reasoning.",
        "The paper introduces a probabilistic reframing: conditional probabilities of unassigned circuit variables given prior solver decisions capture the dynamic essence of CDCL reasoning.",
        "CASCAD is a novel framework that uses a GNN to estimate gate-level conditional probabilities from circuit structures and integrates them into CDCL heuristics for phase selection and clause management.",
        "Experiments show CASCAD reduces solving times by up to 90% with probability-guided phase selection and achieves an additional 23.5% reduction with probability-based clause filtering on EDA benchmarks."
