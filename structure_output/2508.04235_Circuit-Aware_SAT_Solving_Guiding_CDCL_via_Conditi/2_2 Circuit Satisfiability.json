    "section_purpose": "To review existing approaches to the Circuit Satisfiability (CSAT) problem, highlighting the limitations of current circuit-based and CNF-based solvers, and to establish the motivation for a new method that leverages circuit structure during solving.",
    "key_points": [
        "Circuit SAT is a variant of the Boolean Satisfiability Problem that seeks an input assignment making a Boolean circuit's output true.",
        "Existing circuit-based solvers (like NIMO, Qute-SAT) operate directly on circuits but offer basic functionality and underperform compared to state-of-the-art CNF solvers on large benchmarks.",
        "The standard workflow for CSAT is to translate circuits into CNF for processing by high-performance solvers (e.g., Kissat, CaDiCal), but this translation disrupts circuit structure and creates solver-unfriendly representations.",
        "Prior improvements involve static pre-processing techniques (EDA-driven optimization, XOR extraction) to reformat problems, but these do not influence solving heuristics or the dynamic inprocessing phase.",
        "A key limitation is that the rich structural intelligence of circuits remains untapped during the critical inprocessing phase where search decisions are dynamically adjusted."
