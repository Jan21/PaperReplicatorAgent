        "Standard DAGs are constructed where nodes represent logic gates (and, not) and edges represent signal propagation, following prior frameworks like DeepGate4.",
        "Virtual 'and' gates are inserted to directly model joint probabilities (e.g., P(A∧C)) as observable nodes, avoiding intermediate computations.",
        "Virtual 'div' gates are introduced to directly model conditional probabilities (e.g., P(A|C)) to mitigate error amplification from dividing by small probabilities.",
        "Polar nodes (with truth-table probabilities < 0.1) are identified as problematic due to being hard to learn and amplifying errors, necessitating special attention.",
        "The construction uses specific aggregator functions (Aggr_and, Aggr_not, Aggr_div) to compute node embeddings for the virtual gates, which are then passed to a prediction head."
