        "The analysis evaluates clauses by grouping them by LBD (1,2,3) and predicted probability, then re-inserting each group to isolate its impact.",
        "A key finding is that for a given LBD, retaining clauses with a *lower* predicted probability (<0.8) is more beneficial for solving than retaining high-probability clauses, which can harm performance.",
        "Clause probability distribution correlates with LBD: lower LBD clauses tend to have lower probability.",
        "Clause probability is shown to be a more informative filtering metric than LBD alone. Filtering high-LBD (LBD=3) clauses by probability (keeping low-probability ones) yields a net positive effect, whereas baseline methods simply discard all LBD>2 clauses."
