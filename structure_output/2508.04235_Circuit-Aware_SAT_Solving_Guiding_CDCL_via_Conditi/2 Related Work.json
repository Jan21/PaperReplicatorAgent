    "section_purpose": "This section provides a literature review of the two main relevant research areas: (1) Circuit Representation Learning, which focuses on methods for learning representations of circuit graphs, and (2) Circuit Satisfiability, which covers SAT solving techniques, particularly those related to hardware circuits.",
    "key_points": [
        "Circuit representation learning methods can be categorized into graph neural networks (GNNs), spectral methods, and self-supervised pre-training methods.",
        "Existing work on circuit satisfiability (SAT) primarily uses conflict-driven clause learning (CDCL) solvers, often enhanced with machine learning for specific tasks like branching decisions.",
        "A gap exists in directly applying learned circuit properties to guide CDCL solvers, which this paper aims to address by using conditional probabilities of node/signal values.",
        "Previous SAT solving research on circuits focuses heavily on preprocessing (e.g., SAT sweeping) but lacks effective inprocessing guidance during the main search.",
        "The paper distinguishes its approach by using graph-based learning to predict signal probabilities and directly integrating these into CDCL decision heuristics."
