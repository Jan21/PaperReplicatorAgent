        "Clause management is reformulated using a new metric called 'clause probability' P(C) = P(l₁ ∨ l₂ ∨ ... ∨ lₖ), where a learned clause is treated as a k-input OR gate.",
        "Clauses with lower probability P(C) represent stronger constraints that are harder to satisfy and are thus more informative, so they are prioritized during clause database elimination.",
        "Both heuristics leverage circuit structural semantics via embeddings from the DEEPGATE4 framework for probability estimation, moving beyond CNF-level features."
