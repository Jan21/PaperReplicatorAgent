  "key_points": [
    "The explicit division formula P(A|C) = P(A∧C)/P(C) causes significant error amplification when P(C) is small, which is common as it represents a logic probability always less than 1.",
    "Case studies show that even moderate absolute errors in P(C) lead to large relative errors in P(A|C) when P(C) is extremely small (e.g., 0.01).",
    "Even with moderate P(C) values (e.g., >0.3), the division operation remains numerically unstable, producing practically unacceptable error levels (>0.1 absolute error).",
    "The proposed method avoids explicit division by incorporating the DIV gate during dataset preparation, where probability labels are pre-computed and learned as a standard gate type.",
    "The model internalizes the division operation using distinct positional markers for input nodes, eliminating error amplification from explicit quotient computation."
