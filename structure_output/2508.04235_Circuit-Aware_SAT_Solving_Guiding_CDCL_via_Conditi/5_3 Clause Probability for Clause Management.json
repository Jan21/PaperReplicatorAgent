  "key_points": [
    "Validation protocol involves extracting learnt clauses after 50,000 conflicts and filtering based on a probability threshold computed by the CASCADE model.",
    "Evaluation on the LECUNSAT dataset (150 instances, split into 130 small and 20 hardest cases) shows consistent outperformance over the CaDiCaL baseline with LBD heuristic, especially on challenging cases.",
    "Optimal probability threshold for clause filtering is found to be 0.9, balancing high-quality clauses (low threshold) against increased clause quantity with potential noise (high threshold).",
    "Performance is measured using PAR-2 scores that penalize timeouts and include both solving and model inference time, demonstrating robustness.",
    "The probability-based filtering method identifies and preserves more useful clauses than the default LBD heuristic, as supported by analysis in Appendix A5."
