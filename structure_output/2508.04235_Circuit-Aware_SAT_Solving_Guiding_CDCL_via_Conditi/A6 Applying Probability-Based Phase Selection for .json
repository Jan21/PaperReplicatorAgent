  "section_purpose": "This section describes a practical application of the proposed probability-based phase selection heuristic: using the solver's early behavior under this heuristic as a lightweight classifier to predict if an instance is likely UNSAT, and then adaptively switching to a UNSAT-tuned configuration.",
  "key_points": [
    "The phase selection method, which prioritizes assignments likely to satisfy the circuit, can also act as a lightweight classifier for unsatisfiability prediction.",
    "If the solver fails to find a solution within a predefined time budget using this heuristic, the instance is considered likely UNSAT, triggering a dynamic switch to a UNSAT-tuned solver configuration.",
    "The strategy is implemented on top of CaDiCaL with a 5-second time budget for the initial SAT-oriented phase, significantly reducing average solving time on UNSAT instances from 166.26 seconds to 80.36 seconds on the LECUNSAT dataset."
