        "Circuit representation learning is a key subfield in EDA focused on creating unified embeddings for multiple downstream tasks.",

        "Predictive models like DeepGate use asynchronous message passing with representation disentanglement to separate functionality and structure embeddings.",
        "Contrastive models aim to align circuit embeddings based on functional similarity or create function-invariant embeddings.",
