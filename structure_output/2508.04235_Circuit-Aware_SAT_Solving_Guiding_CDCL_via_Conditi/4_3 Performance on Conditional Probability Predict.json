    "key_points": [
        "The model maintains low prediction error (L1 loss) across circuits of varying scales, from small (928 nodes) to large (over 17K nodes).",
        "The average L1 loss on the validation set reaches as low as 0.0331 in the single-condition setting.",
        "Prediction error increases only slightly as the number of condition nodes increases from 1 to 5, showing robustness.",
        "Inference overhead under multi-condition settings is negligible due to the lightweight design of the aggregator functions for AND gates."
