  "key_points": [
    "The paper proposes CASCADE, a novel framework that integrates circuit information from CSAT instances into the dynamic CDCL reasoning process.",
    "CASCADE uses a GNN-based model to estimate conditional probabilities of unassigned variables to dynamically guide two key CDCL heuristics: variable phase selection and clause management.",
    "Experiments on industry-standard benchmarks show significant performance gains, including up to 90% reduction in solving time via probability-guided phase selection.",
    "Additional performance improvements include a 23.5% reduction in solving time via clause filtering in logic equivalence scenarios."
