        "Practical Circuit SAT scenarios require inferring a node's value given multiple assigned nodes, not just one.",
        "Multiple condition nodes (C1, C2, ..., Ck) are combined using a chain of two-input AND gates to create a single aggregated condition node C.",
        "This aggregation represents the joint logical condition C = C1 ∧ C2 ∧ ... ∧ Ck.",
        "Once aggregated, the same probability estimation method (Equation 5) is applied as for a single condition to compute P(A | C).",
        "The approach generalizes single-condition inference to multi-condition scenarios in a structurally consistent way."
