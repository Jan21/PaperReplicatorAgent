    "key_points": [
        "The method using CASCAD-predicted probabilities consistently outperforms the mainstream phase selection heuristic in CaDiCaL, with most results showing faster solving times.",
        "Compared to an alternative circuit representation model (DeepGate4), the probability-based method achieves consistently lower solving times, demonstrating more effective phase guidance.",
        "Significant speedups are achieved, including up to 10× speedup at τ=0.005 and nearly 5× at τ=0.01.",
        "The phase selection method also acts as a lightweight classifier for UNSAT instances, as it accelerates SAT solving enough that unsolved cases within a time budget are likely UNSAT.",
        "This insight enables dynamic parameter adaptation for UNSAT-dominated scenarios, achieving 2× average speedup on the LECUNSAT dataset."
