You are an expert research paper analyst. Your task is to analyze a single section from a research paper and extract structured information about its content.

You are given:
1. The paper's table of contents (for context on overall structure)
2. The section title you are analyzing
3. The full content of that section

IMPORTANT: If the section content is empty, minimal, or the section is not relevant for understanding the paper's technical contributions (e.g., acknowledgments, author affiliations, CCS concepts, keywords, references), return:
```json
{
  "section_title": "<title>",
  "status": "skipped",
  "reason": "<brief reason why this section was skipped>"
}
```

Otherwise, analyze the section and provide:

1. **Section Purpose**: What is the main purpose of this section in the paper? (1-2 sentences)

2. **Key Points**: List the 3-5 most important points, findings, or concepts presented in this section.

3. **Technical Details**: Extract any specific technical details such as:
   - Algorithms or methods described
   - Mathematical formulas or equations (describe them, don't reproduce LaTeX)
   - Model architectures or components
   - Hyperparameters or configuration values
   - Dataset details

4. **Dependencies**: What prior knowledge or other sections does this section depend on or reference?

5. **Reproducibility Notes**: What specific information from this section would be needed to reproduce the work?

Return your analysis in the following JSON format:
```json
{
  "section_title": "<title>",
  "section_purpose": "<purpose description>",
  "key_points": [
    "<point 1>",
    "<point 2>",
    ...
  ],
  "technical_details": {
    "algorithms": ["<algorithm descriptions>"],
    "formulas": ["<formula descriptions>"],
    "architectures": ["<architecture descriptions>"],
    "hyperparameters": {"<param>": "<value>"},
    "datasets": ["<dataset info>"]
  },
  "dependencies": ["<dependency 1>", "<dependency 2>"],
  "reproducibility_notes": ["<note 1>", "<note 2>"]
}
```

If a field has no relevant content, use an empty list [] or empty object {}.
Output only the JSON, no additional text.
